Daisy(bit concerned) : "um..Mist,what is Trace doing there?"
Misty(bursts into laughter) : "Sweet Sweet DaisyDaisyl(bursts into laughter)..”
Daisy(laugh) : "what's he upto now?"
(Misty bursts into even more laughter,Lillie enters the room)
Lillie(bit flustered) : "um..Mist..what..what is it?"
Misty(showing everyone the ring,which she hid before to give the surprize) : "first this"
Daisy&Lillie(wonder,smile,laugh,hugs Misty) : "my god!..within the night too desperately romantic!"(both smirks,Misty blushes)..
Misty(giggle) : "tell me about the time"
Daisy(thinking) : "um..(sigh)..i get it"
Lillie(flustered) : "um..yeah he wouldn't shopli..(Misty and Daisy bursts into laughter)(smile)hey,what..(realizes and laughs)..i see that little brat had it with him all the time when he came in to do the swearing out at the middle of the night(all burst into laughter)"
Misty(laughing) : "and was mobbed while purchasing"
Daisy(flustered) : "um..no Mist keep an eye on him,in too much excitement he's being reckless"
Misty(smile,blush) : "um..as usual"
Daisy(smiles,Lillie smiles too) : "Mist,all these years..then last night... it's just.."
Misty(laugh) : "Pokemon Master"
(Misty and Daisy bursts into laughter)
Lillie(smiling) : "i wish I was there,though Gary would've never kept patience at that time of
night,and i was so distraught..bit today as Dase told me..(smile)..he really has become a pest(all bursts into laughter).."
Daisy(smile) : "it was just insanely amusing..i can never forget this night"
Misty(laugh) : "and the time"
(both again bursts into laughter)
Lillie(smile,frown) : "hey,you must've woken me up..(laugh)"
Misty(a bit concerned) : "Lil i'm sorry,ok? but he was just..he was suffering as much as i was if not more."
Lillie(bit dissapointed) : "um, that's ok but.."
Daisy(patting Lillie,smile) : "Lil,all one needs to do is to understand the number and the contents of the hells that she must travel through/before she finally can get to her beau(Misty&Daisy bursts into laughter)"
Lillie(surprized) : "yeah,um..but what.."
Misty(smile): "Lil,all he was trying so hard to do was to desperately make himself believe that he has done enough to be kicked out once and for all from every relationship imaginable so that now he could just aimlessly roam around the world giving everyone a piece of his mind with his pokemons and fool around with his and all other pokemons all the rest of his life as if himself a pokemon,his image of being a Gengar was exactly true and what he wanted too desperatly came back had be be with me,that's all"
Lillie(flustered) : "yeah,um..strange"
Daisy(smile) : "Lil just let him come here today,i'll fix your meeting(Misty laughs), anyhow why did he turn on poor Trace again(Misty bursts into laughter)Mist,come on(laugh).."
Lillie(bit concerned) : "still Mist, isn't it just too strange..(Misty laughs and hugs Daisy,tears laughing).."
Daisy(smile) : "Lil,the hells he talked about to Brock and us Infront of his wife and then the last line,that even a recently turned public meance like him was stuttering about(laugh,hugs Misty,Misty laughs uncontrollably)"
Lillie(smile) : "Mist,get a hold on youself sweetie"
Mist(laugh) : "it's...it's just..man..(laughes again) "
Daisy(smile) : "Lil,his last line was i don't choose anyone that's not exactly me"
Lillie(smile) : "Ah!that..um..i get it now.."
Misty(smile) : "Lil,all my tears of 5 years or so and all my strains ever all just got laughed away right now,and i've been hearing this since he finally confessed..this..this is..."
Daisy(smile,patting Misty) : "I guess sometimes things like that need to(Misty bursts into laughter again)(surprized,Lillie too) what(laughs)?"
Lillie(smile) : "Mist,you needed this laugh exactly as your cure and even your first boyfriend Ketchum couldn't give it(laugh)"
Misty(smile,Daisy Laughs) : "well he will argue on this,but Dase(laugh)..um..sorry..it's just that almost any words is reminding me of his antics since we patched up again..(blush,Daisy&Lillie smirks)..um..anyway,he told me some novels yesterday and the same which Trace is being minutely and intricately introduced to now(laugh,Daisy laughs)..out of which one was on the fact that you and your beau are always ever a couple like as if this life itself a play but you two have always stayed as a couple like forever..as if a destiny..(laugh)but if one said destiny,he'd mouth them off to hell(laugh)..um,sorry..then from there came his ultimate point"
Daisy&Lillie(unison,smile) : "go on pretty interesting"
Misty(smile) : "see and its about the very personal life of a couple and he has even laughed that barrier off amongst all of us in a way that's just unbelievable (laugh)..um..please bear with me..(again laugh)..um..sorry, it's just impossible to forget the antics..and it was only yesterday afternoon when he was absolutely hellbent and on creating every unimaginably cruel and unsurmountable barrier possible between
anything and himself..(smile) Dase,Lil,we're sisters,and your husbands all of us..we've just been so intricately bound for so so many years,as one unit,then Ash breaks away and we go through all this and then no matter what,we always had some distance regarding personal life an then suddenly..(laughs again)..um..please stay with me..his words are still buzzing in my ears..suddenly he app...(laughs uncontrollably)..i just can't take..(more laugh).."
Daisy(smile) : "you know Mist,that day with Mrs. Ketchum,we kinda always felt a distance since but she also was so cheerful today,we ourselves just laughed it off"(then Daisy leaves the room for some work)
Lillie(smile) : "yeah,um..i feel happy too but i wish icould hear it LIVE"
Misty(laugh) : "all you need to do is to tell him we were destined to each other in a way so that he feels as though your not saying it directly but insinuating..(bursts into laughter)"
Lillie(bit flustered) : "um..i see but..(Misty laughs uncontrollably)(frown) Mist,cut it(smile)"
Misty(laugh) : "Lil,really i need help(hugging Lillie)...the way you are speaking is exactly the right one to insinuate something to him(laugh)"
Lillie(smile,hugging Misty) : "i see.."
Misty(smile) : "seriously Lil,i've been living a dream since we patched up,and you know it doesn't even feel a bit strange to suddenly call him my husband at all,as if the fact i was ever anything but his wife is very strange it feels"
Lillie(smile) : "yeah,we were taken aback when he suddenly talked about marriage yesterday but i thought he was just stressing upon the word but now i see the little prick really meant it(Misty laughs)"
Misty(smile) : "absolutely,and all this words started to flow as soon as he confessed and hasn't stopped since then..he just goes from extremely serious mood to absolutely 5 year chil mood jusy one moment apart..but you know his words are as honest as you can believe no matter what the mood is..and as i was saying you can't say it was our destiny or we were right or best or perfect at all,which possibly is what he is rigourusly teaching Trace now(bursts into laughter)"
Lillie(bit confused): "um..(smile) i see soulmate..always together no matter what..and then he probably extended it to saying all else was like a bad dream not really existent"
Misty(smiles,hugs Lillie) : "exactly"
Lillie(smile,hugs Misty) : "and thats seeing yourself in your spouse and the hellfire(smile,Misty giggles)..and that's exactly about yesterday-Laugh it out(both Giggle)Mist,your beau has turned himself into the Greatest Romance Master as well...(both laugh)Viol would've ate him up in joy had she been present physically here(both laugh)"
Misty(laughing) : "she almost did today itself.."
Lillie(smile) : "Viol too?"
Misty(smiles) : "oh yes!but she can't come before a day after tomorrow but then(laugh)..he's hellbent to runaway with me to unknown islands any moment(burts into laughter)"
Lillie(laughs) : "hmm..that dense little pest has now got real dense.."(both laugh)
Misty(laughing) : "mom said,too much imagination"(again both burst into laughter)
(Daisy enters,laughing)
Misty(laugh) : "what?Trace was scared to death?(laughes,Lillie smiles)"
Daisy(laugh) : "no not Trace,the brat himself(all laugh),said Trace is a bit busy today will be late retunring at 16:30(all laugh)..said(laugh),sorry Daisy but that sketch was so nice i’ve compelled him today that sketching for 39 years today you write stories while i review(all laugh) i realized that poor Trace is a hostage today(all laugh,Lillie
and Misty giggles and hi-fives)and yeah pretty much is being killed off now,(all laugh)it’s just that i guess that none can ever insinuate that(Misty laughes aloud) that his flower was never ever not his no matter what(laughs)"
Lillie&Misty(giggling,Unison,high-five) : "SOULMATE!"(all three bursts into laughter in a group hug)
Lillie(laugh) : "i just can't believe how can one have such belief on himself to be right that he just nonchalantly came to patch up as if nothing ever happened and all was a play and that very thing turns out to be true the very next morning..the very next day all the difficulties that may be we ever had of any kind among ourselves has been just laughed away with no effort..Mist,this guy's real dense keep an eye always(all laugh).."
Daisy(laughes) : "and sorry Mist,but even yesterday all we thought was that he was indeed a cheat,and then the next day we ourselves just can't help but to laugh any resentment off..(all laugh)..this is Patch-Up Master"(all laugh)
Misty(laughing) : "and yet you don't know what he did at Cerulian..(laugh)..oh god!..(all laugh)..after he gave me the ring i came to know that he had first travelled to Cerulian,a city which is his enemy no 1 and you know the viseversa (laughs again).."
Daisy&Lillie(smile) : "um..yeah but why would he turn on Cerulian,Mist?"
Misty(laugh) : "because his flower had to appease random guys coming around for gym badges at any time of the day...(all laugh)..(smile)..no you know what i just feel bad,he's trying so hard to make up for the years that he wasn't with me and his method is to either torture himself enough to see how i was actually feeling,but his playfullness won't allow that so he has turned his attention on in-his-words Cerulian Brats(laughs) roaming around the streets to insinuate(bursts into laughter)
Daisy(laugh) : "with that language and antics and his pests to add to,he'll restart the Sensational Sinisters there(all burst into laughter).."
Misty(laughing) : "and if i ever go back to perform again he must be managing and won't allow anyone except married woman with girl childs aged below 8"(all bursts into further laughter)
Lillie(laughing) : "yeah Mist,he's just too desparate to make the amends and already doing so with his antics"(all laugh)
Misty(laughing) : "and i've been going through for so many hours haven't slept a bit and look how fresh i'm...it's just.."
Daisy&Lillie(Unison) : "Pokemon Master"(all burst into laughter)
Misty(laughing) : "apart from the godforsaken Cerulian brats(all laughs)..he's even more incensed with Vultures..(bursts into laughter)"
Daisy(laugh) : "that's the reporters and pests"(all laugh)
Lillie(laugh) : "and they'll insinuate(Misty bursts into laughter again) always that whatever he may do,he's just trying to trick people and that he's a Playboy"
Misty(laugh) : "exactly,i see the pain that he had been feeling since our separation inside and just had turned on anything that had a hint of reminder to him about queries on his own personal life and anything related to me,same as me just wanted to forget me couldn’t finally realized and so back here but(laugh) you saw his methods(all laugh)"
Daisy(smile,bit concerned) : "no Mist,as stubborn as you if not more,would never still come back normally that is(all laugh) and say he was sorry if he doesn't believe he's done any mistake and would torture himself to death trying to prove to himself that he was morally right as Guzzlord dictates(all laugh) and that is all to him let the relationship go if they don't understand me"
Lillie(smile) : "exactly like you Mist,and as you said and even now so desperate to heal any kind of pain that he only now glaringly feels he's put you through unknowingly,now desperately wants to go through your pains again and again to justify himself,really i mean you two truely as he said soulmates(all smile)"
Misty(laugh) : "along with Chu this morning,master brat and 2nd not not male brat,wasn’t seeing each other for ages only to get this moment most ENGAGING(all burst into laughter),i see too much bonhomie"(all burst into laughter)
Daisy(laugh) : “so already the introductions have been done(all laugh)..”
Misty(laugh) : “where(all burst into laughter)..and the introduction was Gengleye(all laugh),i get in Chu knew me and Sableye too not Gengar and actually well you know yesterday he had 9 ghosts and Greninja looking after me when i was too emotional(all smile) and for this reason though brats like Sableye,Gengar,Hoopa,Dusknoir,Confragigus,Malamar,Spiritomb,Darkrai and Marshadow was there(all laugh) yeah as usual(all laugh)..and also during break-in Sableye was on me and you know he taught all to differentiate not males(all laugh) i’ve been excluded no matter what cause as you know Misty-psychophysicality=Mist(all laugh)..that never changed(smile looking at her ring,all others smile) anyway,so Chu first says,Mr Misty(laugh,all laugh and shake their heads) i see the name is known as well as you when you were rather mentally greener(all burst into laughter) now i see rather happy wrongly cause this idea of master brat as it appears to you is only yours ain’t it(all burst into laughter) anyway, but what’s thy condition cause the report says you were lost in the mist of self and it’s cognition(all burst into laughter),you see Mr Misty(all laugh),this idea that you have about the cognitive process is only an hindrence upon you cause you cling onto things that aren’t you to know you cause your basic premise that you’re you is your trouble to being with ain’t it(all burst into laughter),exactly why you must be tickled after each meal(all burst into laughter),the different foods you have experiential of cognitive that derives an idea of you being confined and those foods contaminate your self hence your current state of seriousness about the varieties of tickling(all unontrollably laugh) thus tickling itself is the right food isn’t it if you can tickle yourself why this urge to know what’s tickling(all brust into laughter) the mental sensation that is(all brust into laughter),see Mr Misty(all laugh) this Gengarian view of life is rather smooth(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,fits of laughter),this stupendus urge you have to be sane why(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits and convulsions of laughter) only cause you want to be tickled ain't it(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears fits and convulsions of laughter) but if you’re sane one tickling becomes an idea to you hence you don’t get the gist of it that is tickling yourself each moment to become tickling self rather than that which is being tickled(all uncontrollably laugh,tears) do you know when you feel i should’ve done this,this and that then the different emotions come up and they tickle you(all brust into laughter) but Mr Misty have you ever given a thought who is actually tickled to produced the feeling of idea of being tickled(all burst into laughter) cause if you’re truely tickled then you will become that hence why would you try to cogitate anything that’s not you like your own being cause had that tickled you,you would’ve tickled that too making both unified hence what remains is pure tickling ain’t it(all burst into laughter),thus Mr Misty,a Sableye is tested when he is born whether he has any materials of insanity or not by means of reciprocration tickling(all burst into laughter)..then that brat Gengar tickled me and Sableye compelled me to tickle them both and Chu to see if i have any material to become mad(all uncontrollably laugh,tears)..this was my introduction to married life(all burst into laughter)..then,my Ash came back after encircling everywhere(all laugh) and said all cause of the fact that they were bored to death cause they had to look after me(all laugh)..”
Lillie(laugh) : “man,some pests these are(all laugh)..master brat(all laugh)..you know Mist i used to tell you these are utter brats(all laugh)..”
Misty(laugh) : “had i given Glalie a few choised company(all laugh) i would’ve been at Unova too still(all laugh)..and my Ash too is at that level you know Drew and May the mad vomit spew(all laugh) and he will go further now that he couldn’t yet only cause i was missing(all laugh)..”
Daisy(laugh) : “man Trace says this is living hell of joviality(all laugh)..but was he demostratig serious tickling yesterday for 6 hours(all burst into laughter)..”
Misty(laugh) : "via insinuations(all laugh)..(smile)..um,no you know when he met me yesterday and himself was describing what he did to you and all else i could just see how much pain he's constantly self inflicting,he real nature is ever the sweetly abstract Ash,but as we broke up and he felt that that nature is exactly what his Misty didn't believe him due to things happening around him and left,so he wanted to test himself first what was his real nature was obsessively and all his abstract philosophical ideas and all now went to it’s climax the result of which is this Kalos returned language(all laugh)contradicting himself each moment to present a demon infornt of you only insinuating(laugh) that he is way beyond these(all smile,Misty kisses her ring fondly)...and you know he was hurt because he was so assured that i know him inside out and would be beside him no matter what he did and that's exactly the hells he was talking about.."
Lillie(smile) : "yeah,Mist i get it Ash did throw that Frontier trophy at me when i cornered him(all laugh) and said 10 years makes one(all laugh),just as much mad about you his soulmate and blind to anything else that is psychophysical including the idea of Mist as a being cause that’s Misty(laugh,Daisy too laughs,Misty smiles).."
Daisy(smile) : "yeah,just opposite to Mist as she was going everywhere only to thrash them apart mercilessly as soon as her Ash showed up in them again and finally was left with nothing getting depressed till that very Ash showed up again,and this you know Mist,when he was piercing us through and through yesterday he said exactly this as an insult,as soon as he lays his first touch,you're running arter him without any consideration whatsoever"
Misty(smile) : "truely Dase,only he could understand my problem and could do what he did..um..i don't know Dase,may be i was still way better than his own condition,what he's doing around now is the actual playfullness that his soul and what he's all about and you can see how irresistibly enticing and attractive it is now that he's just laughing off anything he ever did while self mortifying in a way that it just floods everyone away with him to playfullness,but what he had been doing everywhere before,i just got every bit of it yesterday,and you know all those hells he talked about,not only he himself went through all and wanted more and more so did he subject me to go through with him till he himself confessed that he can't beat me and can't shrug me off"
Lillie(concerned,hugging Mist) : "Mist,i was really scared you know as well as feeling that abject pain myself,i was really afraid that infact he
threatened us that even if Mist becomes insane after this,he can't be leagally harmed and all that,and we could sense what kind of monster he really had become and was only going to come at you with absolute all out to settle something that was disturbing him for a long time but you know as just 12 hours later he laughed all that off,i'm realizing monster or master(Misty smiles) he's an extremely honest guy even yesterday did only said point by point why he was hurting us citing what we might've ever done to him or to his mom and all that...and none were wrong at all..all those abstruse philosophy that his bunch was obsessively taught surely we realize now fully why they behave like this their master never told them he’s any different to them and viseversa and the scale was the most subtle thoughts humanly possible and that translator plan still all of us know the polish that produces that laguage via translators but his love for pokemons only is why his bunch is what they are never viewed tham as a being confined by psychophysicality and that includes you as well and i guess all do take May for example and she too similar(all smile) you the most cause of as he said soulmates(all smile)..”
Misty(smile) : “yeah Lil loves all of you as much as he feels the same about his bros here and May and Drew everyone can’t live without his family and to him either a professional teammate or family,his view of all of you are similar to mine as well his own elder sisters just like a bad tempered quarrel and Oliv and Irie ever said same to all of them just strictly professional yet so sweet and caring and just that playfullness and abstraction makes you his very own if so you want just holds nothing to him cause that's psychophysical to him(laugh,others smile),all family to him like what he so desperately wants that Gengar and Sableye was doing in their most jovial way to me yesterday and does with everyone human or pokemon in the same way,don’t know what a friend is cause all are way closer than anything imaginable and hence this idea beyond psychophysicality that we've been hearing for 18 years(all smile,Misty kisses her ring fondly)..”
Daisy(smile) : “yeah,Mist none would’ve said what he said last like in the way he did had he not known us to be his very own as well and Trace you know told me again today,once you know him you can’t leave him no matter what cause he doesn’t cause he wants to touch himself and you non psychophysically hence no difference persists which he used to quote as Gary told us once(all smile)..”
Lillie(smile) : “and just that is what is the tickling self by self as Gengar says,just not stopping till you have no scant thought of difference as much as you can and in fullest you just become the very self and hence no difference at all,it’s just so much oneness that this language and antics are the only way to express the feelings(all smile,Misty kisses her ring again very fondly)..”
Misty(smile) : “and you know,he was at Undercover and there namecalled not males pulled same stunts on him many times that stunt that really devastated me during his Unova period and all cause of surely none no matter how many and mastered by who or how many could beat Tyranitar alone what to speak of the whole bunch and hence this emotional backstabbing technique and this made him turn on this psychophysicality he ever so desperately tries to get away from from his late school days infact was a mere teenager then 20 years back or more and this along with everything that he was going thorugh since Unova,made my attitude to him seem similar to him that was his illusion so he just lost his Mist somewhere and hence just threw me off and then that started from that Unova incident and then our souring relations and then those press antics after he came out of Undercover were just his agony and determination combined that he will get to the level his bunch is to him via the translators never believed that the words were produced by only us ever they are same to him and we know what this has done to them yeah words to us are basic but to they themselves outlandishly unique hence their state and you know in Unova that incident he told me yesterday and i got it said look no matter what for a few seconds may be i still will get charmed if a very pretty not male comes in front of me that's normal else i'm a monk and i'm not hence only you as well still i can't touch you the reality and you the same and that's ok to me now cause i'm trying only with you that is equally as much cause one won't surpass or lag the other as i told you as it's not possible but for just this bit of promiscuity present now just forgive me at present i've that still(all smile and tears of joy,Misty kisses her ring very fondly adoring it,few moments later) that's why the troubles then at Unova that moment lost himself somewhere despite that not being visible in subconscious and then at undercover so this.."
Lillie(tears of joy,shivering voice) : "yeah Mist that's Feraligator's translated words heard it first day here,turning on own self(all tears of joy and group hug).." 
Daisy(bit concerned,few moments later) : "indeed Mist,now you're telling
us we can see why actually his fooling around and making all us laugh everything off as well,this guy is obsessive in his conviction that whatever his soul is directing him to do,is true and right all the time but that's not visible to him like anyone hence turning on his being ever as said being is the hindrence to self so this self mortification and its just that determination and living in the self that oneness now as much as he can is the thing now in the form of laughter overflooding us as merrily as the hellfire did burn us mercilessly yesterday"
Misty(smile) : "you know,yesterday i cried like i never knew as he was dragging me through every hell he could come up with and much more than he depicted today and i seriously felt i won't be able to take it anymore,and in fact innumerable times he calmed me down by the help of his Pokemons (Daisy&Lillie
shivering hugs Misty)..(smile).. it's ok,he would've gone with me as well you understand had to know who i was beyond my current being no matter where it took him or me to and you can see that he had the faith and it was only me who wanted to walk with him..he took me to unimaginable depths of hell and all the while was carefully observing me whether i budge or not,if he felt i really did budge he would've instantly left me and actually would've still told you everything it would just become that i was his travel companion and that's all so the duty he would've done which he said he would and did as you saw but himself would've become jovially insane in human plane trying to become a Gengar and would've died in a matter of months may be as he would've realized even his Misty won't walk with him everywhere like his bunch sure do so they are what he is and that's it to him being at human plane,he would've become exactly like what a pokemon is his in human body,a total lunatic who only wanted to fool around...and even after i was coming back again and again thrashing
all the fake copies he was creating to throw me off..i really thought whether we'll end ever or not given our own stubbornness and just only then did i realize that he has become an absolute lunatic in his obsession to go hell after hell till he destroyed every ounce of sanity he ever had and it just didn't
feel to me like we could be stopped or wanted to be stopped because i too had become mad in thrashing all his hells and run after him to finally get together it just didn't feel i wanted to stop either as he himself didn't want to,later only realized what i felt then was what he was describing as come for me again and again beyond death..i realized his actual call and obsession with himself to go beyond every death
and still continue to run never stopping and sanity or insanity is a mere term there where he went(tears,Daisy and Lillie too has tears in their eyes) he wasn't Ash Ketchum at all anymore and
didn't care whether i was alive at all or he himself,his being had crossed all limits and he forgot himself forgot me forgot everything just continuing his run as playfully as he is roaming around now to where he didn't know what his Reshiram says everything cognizable is relative(all tears of joy and smile) so he didn't want to know that but these too are only words to him,he had become the very soul that we read and that cant
be described and was at a breakneck speed just playfully with crackling laughter thay all his agony had now become moving somewhere that none can describe...this is poetic and we read only but as you see your crying yourself (tears rolling down everyone's cheeks in joy) and then i found out that i too am always travelling along with that playful march of his soul forgetting any identity i ever knew-i didn't know whether i was alive or dead or whatever i myself wasn't Misty Waterflower anymore as he was no more Ash Ketchum,i too had become the soul that he had become and was equally playfully going just side by side as if playing hide and seek with each other and my pain and tears had also become crackling laughter just like his,i just then felt eternally always with him constantly just the same thing appearing as two different entities to us(all cries in joy,a few moments later Misty in shivering voice)but now about to merge together but actually we didn't want to megre we wanted to keep that separation keep that distance between each other just to play that hide and seek eternally
like mere kids knowing nothing else,he was me,i was him,we had no difference at all and we were only as if mischeviously keeping that distance only to fool around together always together and
nothing there was possible to describe our relationship or anything,we had become the one and absolute only fooling ourselves with this appearing difference that we were projecting to enjoy ourself..this is what is Gengar and Sableye and Chu was doing with me yesterday thay to my Ash are same and hence to me that maddening tune he used to say and that tickling self all encompassing if the appearing duality then tickling comes just nothing else can represent the closest yet purest relation psychophysically imaginable(all tears of joy,few moments later shivering voice) in fact then i realized there was
never any Ash Ketchum or anything else at all it was just me myself and Ash Ketchum was a thing i myself had created to fool around with myself and exactly to show me that was there ever any Ash Ketchum at all and Ash Ketchum had just
shown me that...after this trace kinda state i came back to my senses when i suddenly heard him saying 'Misty, you must marry someone else and have a good family forget a f.. like me first i'm not chaste myself hence accused you too of cheating and second forget me whoose
hellbent of self destructing himself just because he can' that word and idea of anything apart from Ash Ketchum just pierced me so through and through and then his self destruction which he just had showed me to my own realization that
Ash Ketchum is nothing but Misty Waterflower,i just couldn't take it anymore and screamed at him that it's either him or bust for me he just laughed
at my face and that showed his own realization that he went through just like me so many times that he just knew even now he could play around with me cause we're just same so it was all just play even there and hence he can play all he want and said the words that you
won't be able to imagine..he said 'if i f
.. around any random s.. would i still be f.. you around?' ..you can understand what he just threw with what kind of audacity and vulgarity at me as if this world with anything what so ever had no
value whatsoever at all and he was ever the carefree soul knowing he was totally immune to anything that this world can ever imagine to throw at him and this was the whole point he wanted to show me for all these 19 years i guess which he
finally could with complete mastery and utmost audacity which will throw anybody off except his soulmate all while fully knowing exactly that,and now was just as if knew my answer and just fooling around with me as he knew himself his
Misty was not what was appearing before him but has ever been and being and will be his very own self-he himself-so he now decides to swear around left and right with unimaginable nonchalancy with me as if my appearance to him meant absolutely nothing as he already knew and
had the true Misty Waterflower ever always with him and will be...and these words along with my realization made me understand that he was still laughing at me with the the perfect knowledge that his real Misty will eventually in just a matter of moments pierce through the appearing Misty and no matter what he did to the appearance and Dase,Lil,when he said-i'll kill you and enjoy your slow
death and see if you want to die like that again and again for me or rather get a moments chance to be with me if the former assured an uncertain but definite permanent union-he meant every word of it as he himself had long surpassed any limitations whatsoever so even if he was in this world nothing really mattered to him at all...and at
this moment i just said yes he could never be not but only ever be with me as he knows it himself that i was only he himself(all crying in joy,few moments later)..this finally appeased the devil and then with that same nonchalancy and playfullness he proceeded formally to define by word what he exactly showed
me first hand that the nothing could describe our bond in between most appropriately except saying that we're soulmates and now this again would
make us laugh out even in this state(tears,but smiling,Daisy and Lillie stopped crying and looking at Misty now),he finished it with probably the
greatest audacity you can imagine while at that juncture as if all was just as he showed a mere appearence and self illusion with your admitted soulmate and even that that's the word he laughed
off as he knew he had just shown what he meant so his appearance and behaviour or words never matter thus he said that(mild laugh,with tears,Daisy and Lillie closely looking at Misty not crying a bit flustered,with faint smiles)Ash and
Misty are soulmates and this fact no vulture,be it of Cerulian or(all laugh with tears) any other godforsaken breed(now all laughing with less tears)can ever do anything about no matter what they insinuated(all laugh with tears of joy)and then finally admitted to reconcile with me,only after the declaration that even in his biggest all-or-none juncture,all his steps and actions has thus been rigourously proved so that(all laugh)no Cerulian Brats and Vultures(all laugh out loud) no
matter what they insinuated to(all laugh again)could ever prove the fact that Ash Ketchum wasn't honest with himself(all laughs with tears of joy),Lil,Dase,first to me and now to us all,just as jovially he made us cry to death has he made us
laugh to immortality,Ash Ketchum masterfully has shown that no matter what the Cerulian Vultures has ever insinuated to in their damn books(all
laugh again),Ash Ketchum by totally self
destructing himself has rather directly shown anyone what soulmate really means"(everybody bursts into tears of joy and laughter and engage in group hug,claps)
(few moments later)
Misty(tears) : "and you know Dase,Lil when i was giggling to him after this realization,Ash was eventhen still fooling around and his words were 'why
stupid b.. why are you laughing after going through all hells completely losing every bit of your chastity..soulmate,what a f.. word..stupid b..',can you imagine these words even in that state nonchalantly telling a girl he's about to get married
that she is a stupid b.. and doesn't have any chastity?..(tears,smile)"
Lillie(shaking,sobbing,tears of joy) : "Mist,to anybody he can just call the most chaste woman a b.. and the viseversa and would still be equally adored by them cause those are physical aspects or mental he wants to connect to their souls and his bunch represents that with their vulgar words that's natural to them yet they have given up the breeding pwoer to get to this state all said that was hindrence to expansion cause it disturbed us with confusion of what and why and what if and who(all laugh and tears in joy),he had just gone beyond any limitations one can imagine...he has firmly proved that the
Vultures (all laugh) just can't even touch him"
Daisy(sobbing in joy and laughs) : "Mist,I only wish this could be written down or recorded but then again Ash Ketchum then would've insinuated(all
laugh)just like what his immortal enemies(all laugh)the Cerulian Vultures has done(all laugh).."
Lillie(tears,joy) : "and even now we being from Cerulian itself,has he made us curse our own birthplace has as nonchalantly as he could swear at his soulmate telling her she has no chastity,even during reconciliation,to a woman he laughs 'your unchaste' just before proposal and she's loving every bit of it...(claps) cause to them they are eternal without body or mind hence these are rather impedeing opposing plans(all laugh laugh and smile and giggle)..Mist,you've known me how nonchalant i was in my younger days and saw many,but this is only very few can ever do just sitting on the verge of complete destruction only to laugh at the fact that he would still come back
no matter what..(all smile and tears of joy)"
Misty(tears of joy few moments later) : "to again and again prove that no vulture would ever catch him or anyone else who dared to follow him like his own bros infact"(smile,others wonder)..yeah you know then after his proposal and all these asked where's your chastity now(laugh,others smile) then said do you think i'm unchaste even if i really am or not(all smile in tears of joy) then proceeded to tell me things as much as he realized of the philosophy and from Kalos University classes that too Venturiastrog(all laugh) that it doesn't matter chaste or unchaste or like normal states of joy ever only all that's good or bad or neutral always if there a thought of sharing with another or that is derived from another it's just that you are thinking of your soulmate only and if you're single you're just two in one hence still so happy and with this just brushed aside his and my 4 years of hell saying just illusion totally meaningless(tears of joy kisses her ring smiling,others smiles with tears of joy,few moments later) then said all are same your soulmate is most but still at that level of non-difference all really are same hence the monastic lives and all but when not upto that level then soulmate most dear and then family and all and said with this all are most dear no matter who and this his bunch you know says and does as we ourselves were saying some minutes ago all family to him if only you want him and his bunch he ever wants like May is our sis and Drew was told all those is such a jovial manner still ever told May,she said a few times just projecting these that bro isn't atleast of the type as Gary says to pick and throw away someone that easily(smiles,all other smile) and then my Ash told about you all as well as i told you loves you all as his very own big sisters and his methods were your bunch and his questions to them(all laugh) said you two and Trace and Gary all same the stenches are dust on jewels hence unworthy of given any thought to what you are now is reality and hence you all too are so so happy now being the reality(smile,others simle,tears of joy)
Daisy(tears,smile of joy) : "yeah told me yesterday,you and Lillie had you two been what they showed you to be these two men Trace and Gary would've never been there as they were pure logic despite your thoughts of me and my perceptions of you,realized the Gengar in full now as bro and little bro and in-law and everything(laugh,Lillie too laughs with little tears of joy,Misty smiles)..but then last night Lil i didn't tell you even said in the hells i will marry you then tell you no future and if your devotion gets lessened would mean all are just vulgarity and blood and sweat to you the future included so you don't pass at all(laugh,Lillie smiles in tears of joy,Misty too smiles in tears of joy) this even gets the most sensitive and delicate and personal and dear thing sorted out that it's natural and rather like a blessing we just decide and then go forward like that and not mechanical that we will dictate it according to whims and then for all that blood and sweat(all tears of joy smiling).."
Misty,Daisy&Lillie(Unison,hugging each other) :
"Soulmate!"
(few moments later)
Lillie(smile) : "surely Gary's type is of that for sure(all laugh)"
Misty(smile) : "yeah and you know he was checked out at Unova then finally wisdom dawned upon,no matter with me i surely know the number of league titles themselves ensure the character had many great qualities and hence he even while we were at Safforn(laugh) just after all those hours of hell we were at real heaven even then said(laugh),you still would've been in safe hands Mist,just never happy without me(smiles,kisses her ring very fodnly again,all others smile) and Irie told me then itself once just that kind of illusion then that sort of change impossible unless there's serious ego or something like a big force now i realize and she will too just the same Gengar always my sweet Ash(kisses her ring very fondly and smiles,all else smile)"
Daisy(smile) : "yeah,Gengar for sure,Trace was telling me today,only did what he did to me was cause of how much he loved me wanted to be left alone just never realized his bro only wants to comfort him,and then now i relize what self torture he has taken if that amount of nerveous fondling from the age of 17 for 14 long years wasn't enough and yesterday hugged me and realized just like Misty with him,neither can he stay away from me or us(all smile)"
Misty(smile) : "yeah,that's for sure and you know met May last time physically almost 10 years ago,she was 20 then now 30 just imagine the age and then the time her whole 20s has passed and still was talking in phone yesterday and all same behaviour my sweet little sis at 16 and yeah he ok big bro but May too same attitude towards him from the little i got,generally so much self established but with him same 16 year old sweet little girl totally insecured with herself bro sistersit me or else(all smile) that's Gengar for sure(laugh,all others smile)"
Lillie(smile) : "yeah,Lenny like grandpa ever said will return for sure atleast once to atleast shift his bunch only then will be his test of character cause you see still stays away from here can't show his face still physically no matter the demon(all laugh) and only ever saw Gary and even Trace in videos no more than thrice and same kind of antics then but still that's not psychophysical according to him thus not of that type(all laugh)"
Misty(laugh) : "yeah and Giratina and Zeraora has been told to pester him to fullest behind his back showing a few pictures of him that he had(all laugh)"
Lillie(laugh) : "yeah,these pests no matter the emotion,philosophy and all are like what they call their master with him are real master brats(all laugh)"
Daisy(laugh) : "and Viol was spared cause of Mantine lessons i guess(all laugh)"
Misty(laugh) : "of course(all laugh) said Mantine and Brock no different to her hence(all laugh)"
Lillie(laugh) : "and what do we know all about the person who isn't different to Mantine to her(all laugh)"
All in Unison(laugh) : "just so naive(all laugh)"
Misty(smile,few minutes later) : "but you know how much his bunch is associeted with him cause of the viseversa and cause of the viseversa Palkian chain(all laugh) human emotions of that level for so long absolutely nonchalant nothing happened,he said just that they if it became unbearable to them countered it with their views of us which you know Dusknoir said i'm time cause i'm unstable(all laugh) and Bulby sleep powdered me whenever his words became too devillish and then i dozed so Malamar said before dozing she knew if agitated she will doze and now she's dozing still knows when she wakes up same thing will repeat who is she master brat(all burst into laughter) the time cause she's unstable(all burst into laughter) hence is afraid of everything but herself mere kid(all burst into laughter) and you know these were foisted on him and i got some dreamy hallucinations or something like that just always felt ok i can continue and then still made me eat foods twice once forced him to feed me himself first just let all lose on me with the swearing and then still did and each time to tender and even in between hugged me innumerable times whenever realized the torture was too much for me,him and also for his bunch and then too so gentle as ever and then while i dozed was tendering me as he used to and thus took the ring finger size(all laugh) then again namecalled me as soon as i woke up(all laugh)..and actually at a time i had 60 brats at my nerves(all laugh) these were innermost level with whom he was in direct communication at psychic channels and then the 2nd layer and then 3rd then at last he said he used Jellicent,Noivern and Decidueye too to be at my nerves at 2nd and third level respectively Decidueye was at 3rd to make it 63 out of his total 67 psychics(all laugh)..and said still had Crawdaunt(all laugh) and then didn't use Rayquaza and Glalie of course(all laugh) told me Glalie is incensed with me cause i didn't help her getting insane(all laugh) Glalie was at home but told me would've used upto Crawdaunt only cause you know Rayquaza was last psychic present of of there there yesterday and Glalie was banished from the scene so the zapping had to be done by the psudeo-legendary quiz master dragon(all laugh) calls him Quizzy(all laugh) and then if even Crawdaunt too didn't help it then would've proposed me then and there but only then(all laugh) and said Crawdaunt was one step away from jumping himself onto you as all 63 brats were discussing that this brat is too serious bring each psychic brat together(all laugh) and Rayquaza was desperate too to get in to compell me to be seriously dragon thus insane(all laugh)..and no Dase you saw those and then the prescriptions later told me you had 4 months left till you became totally mad and then 3-5 more to leave us and even in that situation our whole 19 years were revisited and he was ferocious on me cause he was so so much hurt and hence the emotions but that itself cured me the most,my Ash never leaves me(smiles,kisses her ring very fondly,others smile) but thus let mad brats at me without Daunty and Quizzy still and thank God Glalie wasn't happy with me for not helping her insanity(all laugh)..really you know,don't know how i survived that with those stuffs being added and then that emotion those 63 brats took and he just told me countering seriousness with joviality as my brats say,the less confining will ever win(all laugh) just ask Trace or Gary or even Daisy now(all laugh),Lillie yet to know these cause she's like Marill(all laugh) thus all babysit her(all laugh) but the others are cunning enough(all laugh),thus they know it the psychic healing processes too much undercover(all laugh)"
Daisy(laugh) : "yeah Daisy has to know these to save herself from the likes of Palkia(all laugh) and Lillie cunningly hasn't so gets the leeway(all laugh) who the day before yesterday told me going forward yet thinking back knowing just let this thing go i don't care how do you know actually what you care about cause you know what care is thus only what you actually know is what opposes it thus you don't know either do you like sanity(all burst into laughter) and i just shook my head and went off thinking today Mist will come and if fed these brats will herself propose that infatuated brat AGAIN(all laugh) and Trace and Gary started from two completely different points to this too vast career now knows everything almost similarly(all laugh) the horizon card is too compelling(all laugh) and you know how many patents the lab has the biggest being the obvious translators(all laugh),Professor ever said the way tralslators work double way would've been impossible had Muk not been there with me each time spoiling my works(all laugh) cause he was called to Ash as you know after the absurdity started(all laugh) the translators didn't get his words to his brats unless he did that in psychic channels which then being at 17 with one year only behind him in his first region was too hard for him(all laugh) so Muk whole day was asked to ask Professor the difference between language,semantics,meanings,perceptions,cognizence,intuition,decision and finally presentation(all laugh) so these words were too hard unless psychic channels(all laugh) hence the translators had to be there and Lenny says man,i just got out of math school after my thesis and got here for a project thought what a dumb job(all laugh) and you know i studied for 3+2+5 total 10 years after high school till 28 then this was at 29 after one year of teaching and a few jobs this was just before i was almost confirmed of a huge post as professor at Glujenpink University of all places(all laugh) and 11 years of abstract thing like mathematics then they tell me judge pokemon intelligence(all laugh) i said mate don't spoil my career which is what i myself did later(all laugh) then after the project was over Professor told this(all laugh) i was like is he sane(all laugh),i realized what impossibility he was asking for and hence wanted to see a bit further cause thought i will sabotage your project midway to show you that you're mad(all laugh) and he's 17 and a damn school dropout(all laugh) then Professor was laughing said just talk with him phoned said you see mathematics ever intriguing but what is this urge that actually enlightens the numbers Lenny they are only within us and our way to see things hence Lenny what happens if you counter this view numbers cutting off numbers you get philosophy don't you(all laugh) then Lenny said i realized this is the most absurdly idiotic brat cause his brats now are going to be foisted upon with absurd ideas to get them mad cause they can't get anything their master says unless psychic channels even there you know these things to a wild pokebrat like Hitmonchan(all laugh),hence first he may become a nerve wreck and then his brats will follow suit(all laugh) thus will turn on him only(all laugh) then i told Professor that look,as little as i understand of the brats they will kill him if he does these(all laugh) Professor laughed and said just call Blanie(all laugh) so was called Cinnabar everyone knows you know(all laugh) i said well i'm from this lab,new import(all laugh) a fan just tell me about this particular brat(all laugh) Blanie said mate just don't get exported ever(all laugh) the brat's brat called a damn brat Charizard midmatch told my Magmorter like,do you know this idea of perfection is actually an hindrence unto us my master asked me why don't we evolve after a certain stage(all burst into laughter) i thought well this brat is a cheeky lad(all laugh) so i told him cause we become bounded by the masters zeal hence the confinement be free thus(all laugh) and this sadly is what that brat was expecting and my brat told me the the brat's pokebrat countered me saying then why are we in bondage yet happy(all laugh) then you see Lenny even a cunning pro like me was scared that if my Magmorter revolts(all laugh) inside a volcano to begin with(all laugh) then i might become a similar brat(all laugh) so i just desisted and this idea got the pest the victory aftermatch asked me of my Darmantian's view of conditional modality who's that pokemon(all burst into laughter) i understood this brat has entered to create a mayhem here(all laugh) i was afraid you see why would anyone incur doom upon own self knowing full well he's going against the first and most basic principle don't let wild brats fondle you(all laugh) then i wanted to see his Charizard didn't realize why a fire type lunatic pokemon is thoughtful(all laugh) then asked his travel companions of the training methods they said they don't know cause he doesn't either(all laugh) then asked him you even at this age too much in psychic channels be careful said like yeah,but nerves are same aren't they like my natural growth is there then they but what my nerves will become in capasity will become cause of the growth and all but Blanie this idea still persists why like you yourself started the love for pokemons so then that is why i take liberties with myself it doesn't change my with my nervous state cause they are different aren't they hence you're in hall of fame cause you relaized this other didn't to this level or yet to(all laugh) then i realized this is most cunning brat(all laugh) so asked what are previous gyms,said yeah Sabrina(all laugh) i knew her plight then and then how she became normal and how great she was so i was bit curious is it the handiwork of this brat's pests(all laugh) then said yeah a Haunter came to me by herself then gave her to her,i said Haunter coming by herself(all laugh) said yeah directly did a certain type of subtle body directly so was ok(all laugh) i was terrified(all laugh) then told him young man be carefull(all laugh) he said no my Whimsicott said it's ok just wants to play(all laugh) he was there with me so it was alright(all laugh) then i realized Haunter was his travelling guide and Whimsicott was the friend of his(all laugh) so i understood this brat will make many trainer,breeder,researcher and of course gym brats scratch their heads(all laugh) then his travel compnaions confirmed this sort of density is what is his training method as well(all laugh) whole day these go on bare minimum training asks Charizard if you know what's fire then why won't you know what's water hence why are you not water type(all burst into laughter) this you realize each of his brats say like Butterfree,Kartana,Kyurem the most cause she is born(all laugh) with Dragonite cause he evolvs(all laugh) and Zeraora of course cause he's uncertain to what he is(all laugh) which Bulbasaur asks all what exactly is what(all laugh) and then Lenny said that Blanine told me yeah he is travelling with his fiancee i guess(all laugh) Lenny said yeah,that's a mystry to us as to the fiancee's family as well(all laugh) cause marriage at first sight is a bit concerning at 16(all laugh) but that's the only normal thing about him to you i guess(all laugh) Blanie said yeah pretty much(all laugh),the girl is the sister of Cerulian gym leader so yeah the distance is minimal from Pallet,great prudence you see given a future gym leader life of many social constraints(all laugh) and she faced me with her Corsola(all laugh) and was trying to of course go the opposite way to her hubby(all laugh) so tried to know why to Magmorter's fire blast she said tackle(all burst into laughter) just too sweet unless it's about her hubby(all laugh),and this guy is here to obsessively teach pokemons and try to make them HUMANS(all laugh) thus human said in return thus becoming a pokemon himself(all laugh) just hope my Magmorter doesn't ask me what is mental fire of that type(all burst into laughter)..yeah,he is a mystry as well as to why would anyone ask his Squirtle day one out in Viridian what is your understanding of your type of Squirtle(all laugh) so Lenny says,man never can get out of this place in any life for sure(all laugh) so see these brats spoiled my career and life(all laugh) and then Professor managed to get the translators saying this is enough to get ocean of money here
and thus saying just watch but be safe(all laugh) then you know HUMAN came here(all laugh),with Marshadow of course(all laugh) then Trace and Gary both started and then the patents and all with bad names too due to Tyranitar(all laugh) who thankfully wasn't asked many times of the beaus and the number theory beind the counts(all laugh) then yeah i told you Mist what earnings the pest has and all are here only(all laugh) and yeah,i realize a bit that psychic healing stuff,just too many processes in specifications don't want to go there cause too complicated(all laugh) the pest himself doesn't know either as you know only intuitions of what his pests know in poke-intuitions(all laugh) and the less confining has been winning since Oranges(all laugh)"
Lillie(laugh) : "yeah after 17 never and nothing sane(all laugh),and Lillie is babysitted cause day one came here got Crawdauntogated(all laugh),this plan you have to understand us is to counter your knowledge of yourself in wrong distributions thus this attempt of yours to recombine them isn't it(all laugh) then Kingler asks do you know you're a not male(all burst into laughter) then that brat Typhlosion says definitely does cause she seems serious(all burst into laughter) like this Mr Oak Mr Oak cause like him you too are running after desires aren't you not male(all burst into laughter) then i almost cried at this while laughing my head off(all laugh),Mr Oak somehow managed me becoming Gary Oak(all burst into laughter) thus then told two words(all burst into laughter),"attitude?"(all laugh) insanity(all laugh) then i was shocked that Typhlosion,Kingler and Feraligator all are not even psychics and Crawdaunt is sadly(all laugh) but still their levels don't vary at all in general nerve fondling and then again Crawdaunt isn't pure psychic far far from it actually(all laugh) so what would pure psychics do like as i heard Giratina does(all laugh) learnt about innumerable medicines to stay sane(all laugh) i'm so happy that i never liked this profession but so unhappy that i like these brats too much for my comfort cause of these chosen ones(all laugh) and Gary says compelled me to change professions yeah that type i realized hence jumped here(all laugh) that's another with different type of twin(all laugh),and atleast Trace has formally studied and did the other things a lot,a tremendous scholer and intelligent researcher,my man just out of blue yeah that type(all laugh) i asked him what is your base(all laugh),um why they tell these if asked properly(all laugh) he asks on their views of existentential consciousness(all laugh) and i ask them of their consciousness of the existence(all laugh).."
Misty(laugh) : "and hence with Brock included we know that our hubbies are(all laugh).."
All in Unison(laugh) : "just so naive(all laugh and group hug)"
Daisy(some minutes later,bit dissapointed) : "yeah,all grand Lil,but still you know,i didn't tell this to you as well,you know about legendary meances to family happiness that are roaming around at Unova,he said yesterday to Mist may get their dirty feathers on us as well if so the destiny whims"
Lillie(dissapointed) : "i see,the namecalls can't get over the fact if you push yourself to honesty and with just who you and your bunch are you can be that or atleast try to be so now rather than trying that wants to jump around with all illegality imaginable at the cost of poor creatures"
Misty(bit dissapointed) : "yeah Lil,this too had to tell yesterday as well as you know him all at a time,i just wish they spare him get the government and kill of every brat there or send them here at Lab"
(few moments later)
Misty(laugh) : "but Trace hasn't still returned i guess he's being again dragged through hells"(all laugh)
Daisy(laughing) : "and skectching them(all burst into laughter) i guess that sketch itself means whole history has to be reviewed and hence our proposal moment too will be uninsinuated(all burst into laughter).."
Misty(laugh) : "exactly that(all burst into laughter) Trace only said you two are destined to each other,i see,destiny,sweet sweet jackal(all burst into laughter) the wrath was cause was hugging me and Trace since Oranges as he does did(all burst into laughter) hence Mime comes saying Tracey,for the love of God(all brust into laughter)this name has been pestering me since Oranges whenever i'm with my flower ALONE(all burst into laughter)then Trace just gave my Goldy and then i ran back inside to hear what treatment he gets and so Trace was flustered a bit and just about said Mi,says,hey hey you namecall,don't call my wife don't look at her don't hear her voice(all burst into laughter) then Trace said man you need rest,i see rest sweet sweet TraceyDaisyl(all burst into laughter)"
Daisy(laugh) : "yeah,my time to get slaughtered has come(all laugh)"
Misty(laugh) : "this is just beginning(all laugh)then Trace said you're making it harder for yourself please calm down,why is it Trace that the vultures aren't around today(all laugh) then tried to flee Greninja was there(all laugh) so then Trace just laughs saying blackmailing says,who disturbed my wife in the middle of night(all laugh) then Trace said Misty will forgive me but you,so when are you releasing it to the silver screen vultures(all burst into laughter) then Trace laughed and said please man calm down,none can say it infront of,my wife isn't it my wife(all laugh) then Trace became the biggest vulture so the vulture killer was out and Trace got his sketched sentimental card out to remind him of the insinuation and then scared him to death and created false alarm send me and mom here for grand union and Trace will be hostaged there whole day(all laugh) "
Daisy(laugh) : "may God bless like hey,hey you jackal(all laugh)"
Lillie(laugh) : "and that little brat yesterday insulted me with the same nonchalancy as when he came back to patch up that no matter what one day we'd
still realize that Vultures could never tame him(all laughs)"
Daisy(laugh) : "and before leaving would play a nasty prank with someone who is most incensed with him and just hours later all 4 years difference would wipe out with a lecture ad around last hours of a night...really,Mist you need to be
gazing him all time(all laugh)"
Misty(laughing) : "Which he himself told his mom to allow him to(all laugh)or else he'll snatch away Mr Mime and battle her(all laugh),said 'we have a deal here(all bursts into laughter) and even to his own mom he as audaciously as you can't imagine said 'you have an idea about me and especially your daughter'(laugh,Daisy and Lillie wonders) then went on to crucify mom who was vulture then(burst into laughter,others laugh shaking their heads)"
Daisy(laugh) : "my god! sort of a pest is this(all laugh)"
Lillie(laugh) : "if mom and dad were here,he would probably just as nonchalantly go and straight ask them 'can i runaway with Misty to nowhere?'(all laugh) and somehow would've managed to do exactly that(all laugh)"
Daisy(laughing) : "i just can't believe that now we just don't have any barriers what-so-ever between any of us and can just about as well play around to our extent and all the troubls that may come
would be thrown at any vulture(all laugh) to try and meticulously get figured out while we enjoy ourselves(all again laugh)"
Misty(laughing) : "and you know he didn't even want to come here to apologize yesterday the first place saying he doesn't need to,i send him Forcefully,went out saying he'll be late as he has to go revisit his farm plans and would be pretty late,went to his beloved Cerulian(all laughes) gets mobbed..and what a way to describe that as well(laughs).."
Daisy&Lillie(unison) : "go on,your beau in a half day has created a mayhem that'll take an eternity to digest and he's only getting started like his brats ever say"(all laughs)
Misty(laughs) : "you know what they're thinking about him,and he went to Cerulian on Talonflame with only Greninja with him but only cause the other was Giratina..(laughs,Daisy and Lillie laughs) and yeah of course his Cozy just add the Ultra to get insane(all laugh)..yeah mom too was forced to listen to almost hour long description of whole bunch along with nicknames(all laugh) said this is very important as each brat gets incensed if they they are namecalled in full cause that's serious ain't it(all laugh)..anyway,i told him to be bit cautious but now as you see he just doesn't care at all and yes i'll force him to be next time but the antics he did there..(laugh).. according to him,Cerulian Mob thinks 1.he was the one to first reject the youngest flower forcing her into severe depression 2.then he came back to humiliate her
,which when fuelled with the previous is pretty dangerous then even more dangerously 3.he broke into her room trying to kidnap her and try to reconcile which was thwarted by the flower who due to security reasons had left for Platue(all laugh)thus he proudly showed how he was the one cause due to which the Cerulian City has lost it's last flower as well(all laugh)forcing the famous gym to be shut down,all flowers having left the city and finally the Sensational Sisters also having been abruptly closed and you know what we mean to the city with the gym in all aspects so he is incensensed with the fact that despite our contributions and all they treat us like with utmost disrespect so now our poor city will get this eloquence left and right with Giti to show them moment to moment how Cozy it is(all laugh) and already chosen brats like the 2 here and then the great Frucient and all have got the full glimpse of these pests including their master pest(all laugh) the 2 were invaded with these two dragonic meances at thei very room(all laugh) and that brat was shown Karapaskar a day in the life of a chosen college suspended Giratina(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,fits of laughter) with an Unltranercozma who went to inspect the types of colleges and why the course works need to be revamped to spot a bigger talent pool(all burst into laughter) for 1 full hour(all burst into laughter) then if that wasn't enough was fed to Gengleye for another(all laugh) then i don't know whether you know or not he can commentate even inside hallucinations like 2 minutes or so even at their level so in-between told him all blood and sweat but his words are in this tone,URINE AND STOOL(all burst into laughter) man,i'm sure not returning in profession again(all laugh)..the 2 here were handled far better but the most poor one has become most ardent and desperate follower of Palkian lie detecting life ingrained in Gengarian philsophy while leading a Salamencian life(all burst into laughter) this all is cause the post is being a 3 time champ in core Elite4 hence is leading Orange runaway dragonic life(all burst into laughter),so i realize what will happen to people there when they approach these pests with this view(all laugh) and all of them singular or plural are mentioned in plural as beautiful men(all burst into laughter) and the Orange one is most others are not that type of beauty(all burst into laughter)..then the less beautiful men were too happy cause they were given poems and quotes(all laugh) you know him even with them ever the Gengar(all laugh and smile) didn't have the time to tell me what the poems were but those men surely are too happy to get out of Water Empress' wrath(all laugh),called Irie yesterday before the date started of course(all laugh) she as ever was with me no matter what even in these last few months,called her each day brief but still tried to cheer me up by talking profession and then all and Oliv too used to come as did Flav and Brenda they were my relief really those four always was there and Harris and Kane in a way too never came since the break-up but you know the other halves did the full job and then Tony was actually trying to tell me move on so Oliv managed him to not get mouthed out of gym(all laugh) and Braum same cause both Oliv and Flav said our sweeties think your beau is so sweetie(all laugh) hence they behaved like little bros and was trying to get him estranged(all laugh) the other two were big bros so was doing the opposite and yeah told me all family to me cause i'm a Gengar(all laugh) have to stop him from jumping with those brats to literally become so(all laugh) and the reminders are to be there each there each day hence so engaging(all laugh),anyway,after the two brats called i asked Irie said yeah those two were visited only hence too relieved too not call(all laugh) and yesterday i called her cause i had a primonition that someone like him might do something to me unless he gets whatever he wants hence alreted them(all laugh) but i went there later druing date and realized how foolish i was to even go there cause i was abducted infact(all laugh) well actually i thought i wouldn't be which wasn't the case anywhere else including my room to begin with hence only went(all laugh) and told Snorlax and Chu to guard the private territory and they had Infernape,Emboar etc as already but Snorlax was later added cause you know most sloth(all laugh) and the brat was about to sleep even when master told all to be alert(all laugh) then Chu was around to lecture me which he did at night(all laugh) so he was sentimentally ferried off and then Snorlax was dragged away from sleeping thus his cutomery most hours slept competition with that damn brat Buzzwole didn't materialize that day so Buzzwole will anyway get certain leeways(all laugh) and yeah that brat was sleeping despite all(all laugh) so with all these Snorlax was incensed and then his disposition i saw realized was back at Unova(all laugh) so he said had 30 gurads around the place and still Noctowl,Pidgeot,Hawlucha,Pelipper and Talonflame was there for sky department(all laugh) 97 was present he said to increase my fear that still not all is needed for his to drive away any hindrence for him from marrying me only after swearing me for 7 hours or so(all laugh) actually all 104 were there including even Sharpedo and Laprass to take of of even that water(all laugh) only Glalie was at home whom i fortunately haven't met yet but this prolonged wait means when i do meet her AH!BEAUTY!BEAUTY!(all laugh) man,i'm so happy that i drove the brat out of my gym Glody atleast would've followed suit else which he was trying to even then and still Jellicent i ever have suspicion off too frivolant for life(all laugh) hence tickling(all laugh) no you know if tickle masters get their hands on anyone may God bless them(all laugh) and Irie also said hunted everyone down at Cerulian before even the very 1st four who jumped me after he just left for Hoenn(all laugh) and none could say anything in public or outside close circle cause Sinnoh,Kanto,Kalos and Unova Elite4 is run by him(all laugh) and even Sinnoh General Government is all over him(all laugh) so thank God that i stopped you all from calling their Kanto counterparts in cause even lawyers were made ready(all laugh) and with all these on his back,he went to Cerulian and due to his antics,so people are incensed and he was now their central focus(all laugh)"
Daisy(laugh,bit concerned) : "Mist,we realize wouldn't have budged for anyone or anything without marrying you hence only so much preparation and hence only also so much joy after the success but no matter the Gengar,this is too dangerous you know,having only four pokemons no matter how strong they were cause in these cases it's just not about them.."
Lillie(smile) : "yeah don't let him next time.. anyhow say too entertaining(all laugh)"
Misty(laughing) : "he said he actually played a card to mitigate the anger there by resigning from Hall of Fame,so the Cerulian brats(all burst into laughter pointing to each other)now think
finally this new pest to public peace(all laugh)is depressed as our flower has finally trodden over his chest(all laugh)rejecting him(Misty shows the ring and all laugh)so,this new meance now having been totally distraught has lost his mojo and went into depression and thus resigned(all laugh)so he goes to the police station asks for protection by
threatening them that unless he got protection quickly(laugh)he'd shoplift(all laugh) at this specific address(all laugh).."
Lillie(laugh) : "Mist,this is just insane tickling(all again laughs)"
Misty(laughing) : "so now he goes to Mr Keller and he describes his appearance to the Cerulian Mob as(all laugh)
'but then appolocalype approachs(all laugh),suddenly that brat appears off the blue/in all smiles with his sinister crew(all bursts into laughter)/to get to a shop as if to get his due(all laugh)/suddenly he declares a ring for his beau(all uncontrollably laugh)"
Daisy(laughing) : "Ash Ketchum really has become a new pest to personal space as well..(all laugh)"
Misty(laughing) : "then according to him the Cerulians say->
'what a night this comrades Cerulian/we must very first get rid of this evil king demon(all laugh)/so comrades lets come and challenge to this man/force him show what he hides below his tan'(all burst into laughter)
Lillie(laughs) : "and he only had 3 pokemons"
Misty(laughing) : "and you know about security so much is his nonchalancy said the police knew that the obvious invisiblity(all laugh) said my Ultranercozma and Giratina will take care of people who may sty to stab me or even throw a knife like that just get rid of guns if bulltes my brats will get overprotective with that force and will psychic the whole place off for an year(laugh,others laugh shaking their heads) and you know told me those two surrounded me to get rid of daggers and all and Giti at the same time monitored the 1 feet circle around me and then if it was needed to be extended or reduced all taught after Unovan namecall incident cause he needed to be protected and then these two did put two most abstruse dragon masks on him for protection that he said with him being in full cognition at physical state and then the danger concerned which pokemons can't solve to full no matter their ability,only meant those two were atleast Glytsohapmemrotusitel+ and their trainging were done since Unova in innumerable civic buildings(all laugh),then i said you have a family now and this was our first night,said why police knew they had to stop anyone jumping cause all knew me and fed them with ideas of handing psychics and else in brief talks when they redied their group and Giti if wanted would've dozed the whole place he can surpass Ghostradarkarrigussonor by a level atmost(laugh,others laugh shaking their heads) and then still had Cozy who can go another level above Giti(laugh) so i realized i'll have to play sentimental cards(all laugh) anyway,just too excited you know doesn't know how to express so what to do either(laugh,all smile).."
Lillie(laugh) : "yeah just let him come to his sisters' den(all laugh)"
Daisy(laugh) : "to insinuate(all laugh)"
Misty(laugh) : "yeah all will eat him up together(all laugh) anyway,then they mob him and accuse him of abducting the youngest flower and insinuate(all laugh)that the Gym,the Sisters and the Show all gone due to him,infact not one but he has abducted all the four flowers(all laugh)to which he challenges them 50 on
1 with Greninja all at a time(all laugh)"
Daisy(laugh) : "well Mist i wish both me or Lil could be surprized at this(all laugh) surely that is just Hydroquastorporus best but with infinitely more intelligence as we know at our cost(all laugh)"
Misty(laugh) : "yeah,and that brat told me this morning itself that,this idea of joy according to Kalos is best fuelled if it's in the middle of sorrow why are you two not bodyslamming vigorously but staying in it(all burst into laughter) you see Mr Misty(all laugh) you know within this time via Chu,Bulby and sadly Feraligator(all laugh) learnt the namecall each(all laugh)..the more intent is the bodyslam the more pain you get(all burst into laughter) but if you believe that the opponent is in greater pain then you're happy and then the opposite if you can't think of the other's pain cause of own being too overbearing(all burst into laughter) hence happiness and sorrow you see Mr Misty(all laugh) rises at the same bodyslamming tool(all brust into laughter) but if you realize that the bodyslamming tool is only invoking the idea of the sorrow and joy only then you realize that if sorrow in negeted by the reverse feeling then in joy or sorrow you will want all of it hence you see you will realize that this tool isn't necessary at all cause this thirst for happiness was already there before the start(all burst into laughter) hence why an unnecessary tool to get the same feeling hence according to Kalos Mr Misty(all laugh),you must understand that this idea of master brat that you have is only a pain unto you unless you're just a novice starting towards the path to that maddening tune cause these are what teaches you to be using the same tool but now being WOKEN(all burst into laughter)..i could barely stay alive after the Kalos wisdom added with bodyslamming tool(all laugh)..and still thankfully GitiCozy were ferried off last night itself to jump you all again today(all laugh)..then my Ash says,see they don't like the fact that you're serious with me(all laugh) anyway,the 50 on 1 was cause his logic is that the more pokemon the more illusion over his ability"
Daisy(laugh) : "really Mist,the more serious you get the more his pests will get philosophical hence 50000 won't matter(all laugh)..man what a brat of a bunch this is(all laugh)"
Misty(laughs) : "yeah,i'll(all burst into laughter)if i can stay alive after these wise sermons(all laugh) anyway,but just look at his nonchalancy just hours after going through all hells to get his soulmate and then all of your stares and all..just laughs at everything and then
as the number confused them and he said
Greninja isn't found naturally in Kanto so more confusion,and(laugh)thus in time he bought he placed the order(all bursts into laughter).."
Lillie(laughing) : "this is just classic"(all laugh)
Misty (laughing) : "then he retorts them why were they so angry and then appeases them by saying Cerulian has best diamonds in the world so where would he go,buying himself the time to deal in the
shop(all laughs again),then the mob retorts all their accusations,to which and now(laugh)please help..he says what do you people want the Sisters or Show(all burst into laughter)"
Daisy(laugh) : "this was said to a ferocious mob just about to jump on him with 2 pokemons and limited police in that short space...and this time that he bought,he proceeded with the shopping..
(all burst into laughter)"
Misty(laughing) : "this according to him made the mob absolutely confused then he showed them some Greninja balance tricks which the brat showed me by performing them on my head(all laugh)and finally dispersed them completely by saying if they mob him and hold him up,his fiancee wont appreciate the Cerulian people(points to herself and all burst into laughter)as much as their diamonds(points to her ring and all burst into laughter)"
Lillie(laugh) : "then he came here to apologize(all laughs even more)"
Misty(laughing) : "and he assured them that he had nothing to do with the gym leader he just thought he could help and so on and said she'll back probably holidaying somewhere brunt out overworking and so on(shows her ring again,all laugh)and before leaving gave them the ultimate advise that no matter how electrifying darling of masses may the sisters have been(all laugh)they
have to also settle down and have a nice family(all laugh)and whether their own beloved fans spare them even for this bit(all laughs)which is his sentiment card that totally decimated the mob and he came he with flying colours on Talonflame in the wrong way(all bursts into laughter)"
Daisy(laughing) : "this just keeps getting better and better(all laugh)he even managed to give an insurmountable defense for us as well..Mist,long live Pokemon Master"(all burst into laughter)
Misty(laughing) : "then he brutally slaughtered all of you(laughs)"
Lillie(laugh) : "yeah we realize what a little brat of a bro(all laugh).."
Daisy(laugh) : "SCRAFTY(bursts into laughter,Lillie too bursts into laughter,Misty laughs)..happiness and sadness dual i too dual these are ever there in family which is dual so am i not your family(all burst into laughter)"
Misty(laugh) : "yeah just recalled(all laugh),107 too many actually in 1 hour(all laugh),man what sort of pests we have(all laugh) and that brat Scrafty came at Johto so incessent only to get in our families(all laugh) anyway,then he said first Daisy doesn't allow him to enter(Daisy laughs),then calls him b.. all the time(all laugh),then when he finally calms her down with how he only tried to judge her baby sister only etc she finally budges and in the meantime Trace comes out to gauge(all laugh) the situation but eats a death glare from Daisy(all laugh) and doesn't come into any help to him as usual as he has always pestered him whenever he got his flower alone(all laugh)since Orange Islands(all laughs even more),then Daisy gives him merching order telling him to at that time of night don't use her as a shiled to protect himself from infidelity that too on his first night(all laugh,Daisy shakes her head laughing)as if unless she told he would've exactly done that(all laugh) which made Daisy to return basking in her glorious victory(all bursts into laughter),while dragging poor Tracey with her as she thought his influence has already corrupted her husband(all burst into
laughter)by every means(all laugh)
Daisy(laugh) : "man this is family for sure(all laugh)"
Misty(bit concerned) :"but um.."
Lillie(laugh) : "go on my child has got a real Gengar as an uncle now(all laugh).."
Misty(laugh) : "and this(laugh),mom was saying yeah so simple despite his skills and achivements,hears it and goes,of being a Gengar as dad wanted in reality words are just them(all burst into laughter) then mom just shook her head laughing said if he of all people saw this would've left home long ago(all laugh),to this says my hubby pest(all burst into laughter),that hence you would've too thus um..(all burst into laughter) mom was almost in tears laughing said yeah your university classmates have taught you well(all laugh),where he(laugh) was taken for a tour by Hoopa(all burst into laughter)..anyway,then says,Gary is jealous of him for taking away his bad boy championship(all laughs)but quickly cools down as he hears his now well
polished defence(all laugh) only to be sent to the lionesses(Lillie laughs hard)who was the biggest threat(all laugh)to his eventual marriage(all laugh)..then he says that the lionesses directly junps to prey upon him by again calling him names and what not while he says that
at this time she should take rest which the lionesses brushes aside by accusing he'll cheat on her baby Mist that night itself(all laughs) and says never to nickname her(all laugh) this gets him serious and hence he says then i'll say my wife(all laugh) this angers the lioness even more saying don't be clever and Scrafty(all laugh)oh and by the way Daisy also told him that he threatened her baby Mist to reconciliation(all laughs)now the lionesses continues to her victory march depicting how much he has fallen to slyly show Gary's rise as Mr Oak Mr Oak(all burst into laughter)..yeah,that too what Giratina and Zeraora has done to poor Gary(all laugh),anyway,then continues that she then pauses to bite him saying he'll definitely leave her sister and finally goes to the end by stating he has no chance of reconcilation with anyone to which he all the while says that she must take care of herself and then
finally dragging Gary's name with future in he tames the lionesses(Lillie bursts into laughter,rest laugh)but still she paws him by giving the marching orders
while reminding him of the root to his just wed wife as if otherwise he would've lost the way(all laugh uncontrollably),then as he comes out,the lion jumps upon him to politely bark him(all burst into laughter)to his grandpa,who was waiting patiently for his turn which was unfortunately he
on the day(all burst into laughter)"
Lillie(laughing) : "this no comedy can ever give you,Ketchum has really caught us all(all burst into laughter).."
Misty(laughing) : "he says he had to be extra careful to lick the boots of the old bear(all laughs)so that he doesn't have to transfer all his pokemons that night itself playing the childhood-
home and humility-despite-fame card that rather appeases the professor but he beaks his head off questioning about his pokemons and whatnot(all burst into laughter)which on the backdrop of his
Cerulian adventure is the most boring anticlimax(all burst into laughter) anyway he somehow manages to get out only to be absolutely incensed to realize that that very momnet,the Tracey-looking-most-cunning fox(all uncontrollably laugh,tears)is dreaming in the Orange of Oranges with his flower(Daisy laugs out loud) while he was toiling hard to even get to his own
flower this realization angers him extremely(all laugh) so he tells Giratina to fetch the brat immediately(all laughs uncontrollably)which he
tickllly obliges(all burst into laughter)as the sweet sweet fox(all burst into laughter)comes out he doesn't know which side to sail to(all laugh)only managing to fire out the why drag all in bullet which by then he repeated so many times
that he got angrier(all laugh)and fired in the canonball that all he wanted to do was to check the chemistry before parade(all laugh)which this fox wickedly shields(all laughs)by saying that they'll not be his flower but follow suit always which stuns him so much that he resorts to the embrace-it-out option(all laugh)meanwhile Daisy again comes out with the groundbreaking declaration that she had eavesdropped them(Daisy bursts into laughter,others follow suit) which as if was Unown to him(all burst into laughter)and declares that why he was back whether he had spoken to her younger lionesses(all bursts into laughter)etc to which he continues the sentiment card which Daisy doesn't think she can handle for long(all bursts into
laughter) thus tries to pull off his own trick on him(all laughs) by selling him the same wisdom nut he had earlier sold her(all burst into laughter) saying that alright she admitted her baby Mist went to him intentionally and would roam around him all her want for the rest of her life(all laugh)but she shouldn't suffer for her devotion(all laugh)which he rather ducks out(all laughs)but is again incensed again seeing her gentleman jackal(all burst into laughter)was enjoying his death all the while smirking and thinking of the final attack that'll absolutely nail him down(all burst into laughter),so to foil Daisy again from dragging him inside(Daisy laughs)he uses him to insinuate(all bursts into laughter)that his actions
endangered his pokemons which this wicked fox jokes out(all laugh)and makes a comeback by advising him to phone around all from Brock to God(all laughs uncontrollably)which he then somehow bypasses only to be so incensed as this constant hindrence having pestered him for 17 hears whenever he wanted to adore his flower in complete seclusion(all laughs)and even today was upto his old tricks(all burst into laughter)he
using Giratina again creates an illusion to play a prank on Brock of all people who was most incensed with him and viseversa for trying to detach his flower from him(all laughs)..by-the-
way,sweet sweet Brock(all laughs)is in a real danger now though he did say everything in brief to him cause of the right words which his sweet sweet Trace(all laughe) got into today again as he was hugging his flower(Misty blushes, other two smirks) snatching her away from the kitchen threatening his mom of robbing her pokemon in a deal(all burst into laughter)and his 17 year long nemesis again had to choose the exact same time(all burst into laughter)to insinuate that(all again laughes)he was his flowers BEST choice(all laugh uncontrollably)which as usual he started with sweeting the man only to call a false alarm and forcing everyone out of the home with the intention to have the grand lunch here today(all laugh) and has probably showed Trace all kinds of hell that he didn't show me and rigourously proved to him about one being-two-appearance-only for the illusion to break theory unless he truely has killed him(all laugh)which he will do as he now possibly has come to know the intricate details of each of
those damn brats once more in FULL DETAILS(all laughs)that had the audacity to even look at his flower while he wasn't(all laugh)which includes unmarried females as well(all laugh)as
due to him this brand if young has always been a constant problem for him(all burst into laughter) to handle and according to him they tried many pranks to get his attention off from his flower(all burst into laughter)as well as the threat that they might've influenced his flower rubbing her the wrong way(all burst into laughter)so Brock being a constant encouragement of such brats,his time is really numbered(all laugh)though hopefully in the last hours of night Trace of all people again to his utter
disdain(all laughs) had the audacity to call him and insinuate (all laughs) that his actions weren't right(all laugh)..and you know thank God that i
snatched his phone away otherwise he would've again set Gengleye upon on you(all laughes) and this was after he could give the ring(all laugh)which if wasn't the case Trace would've been in such hellfire that no vulture(all laugh)ever
could've insinuated him out of it(all laugh),then Trace rather idiotically forces her flower to compell him to call Brock to God(all laugh)at that time of night,and already these little Vultures insinuating around him if weren't
enough(all laugh)only for him now they had their dirty eyes on his flower's beauty nap(all bursts into laughter)as well,so this sends him right into hell(all bursts into laughter)and i somehow managed to dissuade him from appearing on Brock's bed with Gengleye that very
night(all laugh)and that too having known that even on that day Brock had the
audacity to not only doubt him but directly causing his flower some pain on her first night by insinuating(all laughs)her that he doesn't quite understand it,and this had put him out of his mind
absolutely and he wanted to personally empty the whole Oak Lab pokémons on Cerulian and Brock(all laugh) and possibly on the whole world(all laugh) or may be alert the whole Elite4 to crush every vulture(all
laugh)that ever appeared on Cerulian sky that day(all laugh)but he would've
absolutely loved to completely devour sweet sweet Brock(all laugh)himself and i barely managed to calm the Gyarados of Gyradoses down(all laugh)only to tell him to phone-it-out(all laughs),which he obliged and then you know(all laugh).."
Lillie(laugh) : "man had Gary been there would've been real bash(all laugh) not of that type(all burst into laughter).."
.........................................
[hours later,Gary enters mid conversation,and meets Lillie,Lillie
hugs him suddenly]
Gary(bit surprized hugs Lillie) : "um..Lil.. what's up?"
Lillie(laughing) : "Ketchum has caught me as well" (all three sisters bursts into laughter)
Gary(bit puzzled) : "um..i see,hey all..happy to see you..hey Misty..i have a big big surprize for you Lil and Daisy you too but what was it that.."
Lillie(laughing,hugging Gary) : "just send your surprizes to vultures now(all laugh),he has insinuated about our  private life to everyone(all sisters again burst into laughter)"
Gary(flustered,smile) : "um..what's he.."
Misty(giggling) : "Lil can i be him?"
Lilllie(laughes) : "be my guest,Dase start insinuating(all three again burst out into laughter)"
Gary(confused) : "what are you.."
Daisy(laughing) : "so Lil and Gary turned out to be the best fit for each other after all,ain't it Mist?"
Misty(laughing) : "sweet,sweet DaivyDevil(all sisters burst into laughter).."
Gary(laugh,a bit flustered) : "what are you three upto?..come on Lil,i have to.."
Lillie(forces Gary to sit down,sitting with him as well) : "just watch it and laugh yesterday out(all sisters laugh)"
Gary(bit shocked) : "um..that.."
Daisy(laughing) : "um..but really don't you think that their recent tension was just due to a confusion among.."
Misty(laughing,immitating Ash) : "sweet sweet Dase(all 3 again laugh),why is it that i smell a few vultures cycling above us(all three again laughs,Gary smiles as well)?"
Daisy(laugh,mocking confused state) : "um..fine they were perfect for each.."
Misty(immitating Ash's frown,all laugh) : "what was that Dase?do you imply that it's as if they Became perfect,became right,became together,became..(all laugh)"
Daisy(laugh) : "um..but when they first met.."
Misty(laughing,closed eyes, immitating Ash) : "Dase stop just there,i know what you're thinking Dase i know it,i can feel the vultures,Dase, they're trying,trying so hard to land on a spot(all laugh),they are so ecstatic about there success..Dase..i can feel their joy..i..i can see their eyes,Dase,Dase(all laugh)they are already feeling
their impending success,Dase,look how they are caressing the Champaigns..(all three burst into laughter)"
Gary(laugh) : "what's Ash been upto off late now?"
Daisy(laughing,mocking a sigh) : "fine,they were always to become close.."
Misty(laughes, Mocking Ash's smile) : "so they were to ALWAYS to BECOME close?..Dase,this..just this(all laugh)..this is it..(Mocking Ash's frown and language) " the vultures have reached their spot..(Mocking smile)Dase,look at the celebrations..Dase,Dase,Dase..(all 3 burst into laughter again).."
Gary(laugh) : "come on you, I don't.."
Lillie(smile and stops Gary) : "just enjoy it,let the vultures do your works"(all 3 laugh)
Misty(laugh,mocks Ash's stern look) : "the vultures would insinuate that if they waited a bit more,a bit longer,a bit patiently,a bit meticulously..(all laugh again)..then it Could've been someone else,Could've been someone better, Could've been someone sweeter..(again all laugh)"
Gary(laugh) : "i get it.. Ashey changed from universally trashy to unequivocally sweetie.."(all burst into laughter)
Daisy(laugh, immitating sigh) : "alright,fine,they were always destined to each other.."
Misty(laugh, immitating Ash's scowl and irritation and anger) : "Destined?Destined?Destined? Destined?(all laugh)..as if it they never knew,never saw,never felt,never understood,never..(all laugh again)"
Daisy(laugh,again Mocking sigh) : "ok,ok..they were forever like like this like soulmates,no matter what they'll always come together"
Misty(mocking Ash's closed eyes and smile,laugh) : "Precision,Precision"(all burst into laughter).."
Daisy(mock dissapointment,laugh) : "Please let me go..they were like this forever..."
Misty(mocking Ash's anger) : "what did you say? forever?forever?forever only having the trouble to come to each other whereas that itself is no good as the Gym is forever packed during shows(all burst into laughter) and then he being Mr Oak was on-the-fly anyway as that type Mr Oaks do(all 3 uncontrollbaly laugh,Gary shakes his head laughing)..no don't try to leave,Dase,else Gengleye will tickle you to death..(all laugh)..(again mocking Ash's anger) all those damn brats that ever had the audacity to challenge Gary's little sweet cherished flower to a
gym battle at 4:17 in the morning with an Onix(all burst into laughter)..the damn vultures must very well know it,understand it,digest it,swallow it, assimilate it(all again burst into laughter)..that it's not then,it's not now,its not will be,it's not has been,had been,will be,not was,not is..(all again laugh)..but IT IS(all burst into laughter)..it IS a fact that Gary and Lillie are the same thing appearing to each other as a bit different,bit distant,bit amusing,bit charming..(all again laugh)..but they are always EVER the same reality only appearing as different here thus they are in essence ever the same constant ONE(all smile)and no forsaken Vulture or damn Cerulian Mob..(all burst into laughter).. can EVER do anything about it(all laugh)..."
Gary(laugh) : "that's how the night passed then..(all burst into laughter)..and Giraora invaded(all laugh).."
Misty(laugh) : "Dr Gary Oak Mr Gary Oak(all laugh)..man i got Gengleye and Chu then Greninja and heard what the whole dragon bunch do and Seismirottzel and Crawdauntogatorlerphlosion universities exchanging bright students left to right(all burst into laughter) like Karapaskar hallucinations to the Frucient leader an hour with a college-bully Giratina(uncontrollably laugh,tears),then Malamar,Zeraora,Talonflame,etc(all laugh)...then finally today morning itself with mom being forced to listen almost one hour lecture with full detailed activities of his bunch(all laugh) that before being born did you know what at this moment to me mean my horn(all burst into laughter)..man,Gary you and Trace may you be forever blessed(all laugh).."
Gary(laugh) : "yeah,finally the hubby brat is here(all laugh,Misty brusts into laughter) so the Gyarados is out poeming the whole world again(all laugh,Misty uncontrollbaly laugh)"
Misty(laugh) : "no you know your words reminded me,ardent Cili called at dawn(all laugh) too excited so was fed not her but another same name and second cousin so same family why bother Misty Fletch(all burst into laughter) then Cilan got angry,yeah,i see Fletching the WHOLE WORLD(all brust into laughter) and his description of his bunch is like this
yeah that Goodra(all laugh) a psudeo-legendary psychic dragon world feared goes to you and afterwards asks me to count the days since when i've been serious(all burst into laughter) a supremely intelligent mythical name and this is your contribution in his life(all uncotrollbaly laugh,tears) then finally realized that the exchange prank was directed(all burst into laughter) so talked with me and all then i assured him all will be well tamed(all laugh) and just say good night so finally a bit assured(all laugh) so also says good night and just before he could cut off my hubby pest says(all laugh)in this tune to good night,KOMMO-O(all burst into laughter) then(laugh) Cilan in reply says,Ash don't disturb 'mam and cut this language(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears,few moments later)..KOMMO-O(all burst into laughter).."
Lillie(tears laughing and fits of laughter) : "but don't cut this language(all burst into laughter)"
Misty(few moments later,smile,blush) : "um..well at this rate i could even tell the..um.."
Daisy(smirk) : "proposal"(Misty blushs,hugs Daisy)
Lillie(hugging Gary,smile) : "go on, it's never been any better"
Gary(laugh,hugging Lillie) : "man..really Misty,you've bitten the pest long enough"(all burst into laughter,Misty blushes and Daisy and Lillie smirks and Gary too laughs)
Lillie(smile) : "anyhow Mist,go on with the proposal line.."
All in unison(laugh) : "yeah go on"
Misty(smile) : "alright,here,so,that one reality that is due to this mind and body seeming just like a mirage as Gary and Lillie to themselves as appearing in this world and though they realize that actually Gary is also Lillie and Lillie is also Gary yet as they have this difference appearing before themselves through this world their relationship is thus best interpreted in a way which is that,that which here is appearing as Gary and that which here is appearing as Lillie may please answer the question whether they do want to be (smile) Married.."
Gary&Lillie(hugging each other and holding hands,smile,Unison) : "WE DO"
(Misty and Daisy claps and then all smiles and then laughs)
Gary(laugh) : "and Trace is having his proposal rehearsed since morning till now..(all again burst into laughter)..meticulously(all again laugh out loud)..and i realize with hommade announcers my ceremony was a wastage of money(all burst into laughter,few moments later)..but really Misty knows it but now the surprizes guess.."
Lillie(smile) : “the farm annexed?”
Misty(smile) : “way more gigantic..”
Daisy(smile) : “i see many arcs added?”
Gary(smile) : “6150 arcs,the full max,who Viridian Forest conserved area under Oak Labs(all wonder and clap and cheers)..and then again the 3 Cities cup renovated,Pewter getting many many things,Brawn’s laugh with be more hearty as well cause he gets his things as well and with all these Pallet Municipality will have to work hand in hand with us as well to get things done here and to be honest whole town will take a new shape but rather like a villege yet having all current and a few new facilities with Oak Labs virtually becoming the main centre..(all smile)..”
Lillie(hugging Gary,smile) : “really you know,Ketchum with his theory says and i realize as well we’re all a family for eternity infact all of us(all smile)..”
Daisy(smile) : “that’s for sure with my experiences last night but(laugh) we must word carefully still(all laugh)..”
Misty(smile) : “but that was only the least important of the surprizes..”
Gary(smile) : “second is Mr Hector Skechit was in an extremely serious legal toruble and his company was accused of encroaching Muk Inhibitant at Gelumsyellow and this falsehood was propagated by the rival groups fuelled by Platue vultures of certain HQ factions,then Ash was there saw a picture of Misty and that was the turning point as you must’ve heard and he was as usual incensed on the whole world that Misty wasn’t alright and he didn’t know her relationship status(laugh,all others smile) so chided the whole world from there that paved the way for the factions to take a grand beating and thus their works and all came to light and this was found out that Elite4 members themselves want to destroy may be a whole pokemon specis which is of course Kanto only and this is extreme serious offense as you know and a huge thing and many more a huge part of that nexus at Platue has been sweared into light infact and this gave him the leeway to swear off everyone from Pallet and get may be 100 deals done and yeah Giratina and Ultranercozma were indespensible there too(all laugh) and thus Dr Tracey Skechit’s name has come in front and Hector finally has come to know what he is and Ash too spoke in details about him,you know whole world knows Ash anyway and then Hector has got rid of his 22 year long illusion and his dad too and Trace has been finally too warmly accepted back and the rest is just happiness for all of us..(all amile)..”
Daisy(broad smile,shivering voice of joy,hugging Misty) : “really Mist,your beau is a patch-up master(all smile,Misty hugs Daisy smiling)..”
Lillie(smile) : “yeah,got the full family together finally..”
Gary(smile) : “with additions Lil,guess..”
Lillie(hugging Gary,broad smile) : “Viol and Brock will be here(all smile)..”
Daisy(smile,hugging Misty) : “this is truely heaven indeed(all smile)..”
Misty(hugging Daisy,smile) : “will get better with time Dase just the last and the best is left still..”
Gary(smile) : “Mr David Duncun,Pokemon Master Hall of Fame,6 leagues,6-1,grandpa might’ve told you about him,Ash’s undercover colleague main battler there was,i knew his name,but the biggest heaven is he is the brother version of May to Ash,just Brawn in nature and he comes with his other half,Zara and this sister-in-law of ours is out of profession and is a lawyer of big fame having worked many cases the two met during undercover itself then married after coming out she is too sweet like May as well and is the Drew version to Ash without those vomitting tests(laugh,all beams)..”
Lillie(hugging Gary,smile) : “during undercover and thus both have become family,we were saying he can’t live without family and thus it just by itself keeps revealing new gems and they keep this expanding(beams,tears in joy,all else beams,Misty and Daisy too tears in joy hugging each other,Gary broadly smiles)..”
Misty(hugging Daisy,smiles) : “my Ash wanted to become a Gengar so desperately cause nothing was left for him to do here was his idea and then you know his bunch and then that bro vs beau differentiation press,that was the pick of his instability and ghosts were all the time with him..Dave he met at Unova Round 1 itself in finals and Viol saw that match i recall and from there then undercover,Dave’s parents were killed in an accident cause by Team Rocket when he was 15 and thus the rest is understandable why he jumped in the fire and then my Ash went there and were great pals then like cousins,Zara too he knows as Gary said too well,and then Dave’s last region was Kanto,fought me for 32 minutes penaltimate badge,knew about me too well since undercover itself 4 years were like that too close and he lead Lance by 1-0 in extra sets so that too tells you who he is,he’s from Cellestic Twon,Sinnoh and Zara too from Sinnoh itself  and then again as i said during that famous press conference he realized my Ash won’t be sane and alive for long and confronted him then my sweet Ash you know ever too caring to them like what he was to May and was the same and Dave said,don’t become a Gengar so fast atleast me and Zara are reasons left for you this life atleast for you to not become a Gengar(all broadly smiles)..and that was the cherry on the cake of 4 year cousin relationship then they are there at the farm just a set up and he wants to settle here at the colony now it’ll be and Zara only too happily reciprocated,Dave’s parents were in farming and uncle too and his cousin bro Lucian and his other half Tyala all very well to do and they are all just Brawn my sweet bee said and they know him and too happy with Dave’s decision if he decides and i know atleast if given a chance none would want to leave my Ash for sure(kisses her ring and broadly smiles and hugs Daisy,all others smiles broadly)..”
Gary(smile) : “and we all have seen him(smiles hugging Lillie all else smiles as well)..”
Daisy(broad smile,hugging Misty) : “yeah his lackie,great incognito(all smile and Gary laughs)..yeah David Duncun Professor said a few times,i recall now,only man to have ever lead Lance 1-0 in extra sets very marginally lost the second and then in third Lance got him and said was as good as Persy or he himself if not better..and yeah the undercover double hall of fame both he and Ash infact to be honest and i guess with Lance here and Trevor there all too known and fond of Ash and Dave too,that will be used to settle here as Kanto Hall of Fame trainer..yeah,Mist paradise by every means the bunch was here master now returns with extended family and such refreshing form(hugs Misty and beaming,Misty too hugging Daisy beaming,Lillie tears of joy hugging Gary beams and Gary also hugs her smiling)..”
Gary(smile) : “yeah,4 huge things really i was emergencied to the farm and then Dave greeted me fooled around a bit then the real identity and too nice person i got too interested a battle geek really and the Orange league he didn’t win at his 5th region was only a runners up there with opponent 15 seconds exactly late to pokecentre(laugh,all smile)..Zara too too sweet girl and they are married for 3.5 years now and yeah will be here told me none surely will leave Ash and family won’t for sure(all smile)..Lomstom will be reinvigorated as i said with 3 cities cup and he will manage and the Frucient Gym too Ash or he will provide people and cerulian goes 1 year shut down huge renovations there,all the plots as usual ushurped by that language cause they weren’t anywhere as he was travelling on Reshiram to places(laugh,all smile)..and these 6150 arcs with Brock’s provision if he so wished were made way before actually would’ve been done anyway even if he and Misty didn’t see each other at all and you all know about the quotes and thus you see,all he did was to give everything he could to us and go off with his bunch to be them and you know with that break-in and all he has reached an unimaginable state of attachment with his bunch in psychic subtleity and hence would’ve tried that too much and the result is known and all cause of the illusion of his own hindered his view of his Mist and hence his troubles now all fine and so you know Misty i congratulate you for yourself and also on behalf of whole family and me personally that i’ve got my twin back(all smile)..”
Misty(smile) : “yeah Lil, and Dave will be given our home here all renovated in renovated plans and mom you know herself will agree and will most certainly agree to come here at the lab and fulfil your wish for your mom as well(beams hugging Daisy,Daisy beams as well hugging Misty,Lillie tears of joy hugging Gary beams,Gary broadly smiles as well)..”
Gary(broad smile) : “well,bro for sure(all smiles and beams)..and Gradpa will be too happy as usual to have his daughter finally staying here(all smile)..(few moments later)..anyway,another huge news Misty knows this too Ash has faced a Lugia and Muked it(laugh,Misty smiles,others smile and wonder)..yeah,after the picture realization that Misty was his soulmate indeed still went to Kalos to confirm is knowledge from where he gained them at Venturiastrog of all places(laugh,all others smiles,Daisy laughs)..many lectures and books and so on 2 years thus his language and the discourse too(all laugh)..so went there a brat as usual was roaming around with max swelled up Lugia and Ash was contacted by Elite4 and whoose head Persy is a fanatic fanboy and Persy we all know(all laugh) he talked with grandpa today itself and said,Ash wanted Muk(all laugh) cause Lugia was ‘namecalled illegally swellwed up namecalled half-grown namecalled Fearow’(all laugh) got him as you know that time and then went there,Muk saw Lugia said you don’t know how to behave with humans what’s the point of your glory vs me(all laugh) and went to Muk Ash and did as usual without resistence(all laugh)..this got the human brat perplexed and Fearow too then Fearow said you’re under bondage(all laugh) this is the trap that Ash and his brats are practising to get in and out for 19 years(all laugh),so Muk says,bondage is that which bounds you in this idea of battling for a reason that still doesn’t exist cause you can see i have no such intention and then you think so cause you want that hug of yourself(all laugh) that you can’t find cause you only hug what you like(all laugh) but they change this is better than that so you hug them but still all aren’t inclusive you’re tired cause what is now good isn’t later so if you don’t know this whoose in bondage(all laugh),this gets Fearow too confused(all laugh) then Muk says,i hug the changes of being to self when this idea of being tries to hug others i hug the being itself thus the being hugs me so i am me and thus i hug you only thinking you’re me,so you see whoose whoose beau(all burst into laughter)..actually it was the simulation of Muk vs Latios way back in Orange Finals and Muk again comes victorious(all laugh) so then the brat was caught and Lugia was at hospital later released and then of course this with Muk inhibitation here and then Hector all got Trace to have his full family again(all smile)..”
(hours later Ash and Tracey enters mid conversation Gary is present as well,all burst into even more laughter)
Daisy(laughing) : "three cheers for Ash Ketchum,Coupling Master"(all burst into laughter and cheers)
Ash(smile) : "um..thanks..that's funny..hey Gary,hey all..um..sorry about last.."
Tracey(laugh) : "sweet sweet Ashy-boy..(all laugh even more)"
Ash(laugh) : "um..well universal sweet-boy to Orange-boy to stricken-boy to longing-boy to confession-boy to friend-boy to PLAYBOY KETCHUM to undercover-boy to demon-boy to villian-boy to philosophy-boy to finally comedyboy now...(all laugh)..Gary,who's that Pokemon?"(all burst into laughter)
Lillie(hugging Gary) : "Ash,you've just given us that spark back again with Dave,Brock being here,6150 and Trace back to his family again and finally if Mrs Ketchum settles here with us(all smile)"
Ash(smile) : "um..thanks Lillie..and she will a deal(smile,Daisy and Misty smile,Lillie beams,Gary laughs)"
Daisy(mocking Ash's anger) : "what did you say Lil?got your spark back again,huh,again?again?.."(all burst into laughter)
Ash(blush) : "um..well it's a good thing that.."
Tracey(laughing) : "Vultures aren't insinuating anything.."(all laugh uncontrollably)
Ash(smile) : "well vultures did insinuate this one out(all laugh)"
Daisy(smile) : "surely Ash,i was never more angrier on anyone more when we first called in the night and never happier about the same person in a matter of minutes(all smile).i still can't imagine how someone insults just about anyone to death and torments his beloved girlfriend to hell only to vividly direct her to jubilantly accept his proposal and then goes to fetch the ring overnight in a city in which he's the most cherished villian and gets mobbed while somehow managing to get the ring by forcing the mob down to utter confusion and on the way back to his fiancee rather takes a detour to nonchalantly come back to patch up with those whom he insulted to the absolute extreme just hours ago during their bedtime with such ultimate faith that nothing ever happened that he pulls a nasty prank on them in the end andthen jovially goes back to make his proposal official,which takes place moments before in the deep night under the glare of the most incensed people that are his family or like family who wants to crush him into pieces out of resentment over his prolonged cruelty and rudeness,pulls off a lecture with the words giving a completely different impression to what he's trying to say,which is actually the most personal matter of his relationship with his fiancee,all this taking place via a conference call where his fiancee is present with him as well,calms his beraters down to such a degree that they can't help but to become most warm,frank and beloved to him as they'll remember the night forever as every time it'll give them an ultimate strength and joy,and then all the surprizes and David as your bro just proves that you keep extending the family and they keep revealing themselves and Lugias too(all laugh)really,Ketchum(all laugh),the last 24 hours alone should get you to the very top of Hall of Fame (all smile)..”
Ash(blush) : "um..thanks Daisy..it was..um.."
Tracey(laughing) : "SO GLORIOUS(burst into laughter,Ash shakes his head laughing,all laugh) i won't give in no i won't give in till i become the most beautiful brat(all brust into laughter) this is the 3 brats that roamed around who are categorized as more or less beautiful(all burst into laughter) and i guess you all know Gary might not that the more category at core Elite4 Orange with 3 titles has been awakened to the Salamencian life with Gengarian philosophy minutely detecting the lie of the being to unveil the Palkian self(all burst into laughter) may God save Orange(all laugh)..but hours later by this very same man who laughed his whole night off, i had the fortune to be graced with the most intricate epilogue(all laugh)so that no sinister words like BEST,PERFECT,FOREVER OR DESTINY(all burst into laughter) can ever get their dirty hands to his perfectly attuned logic on how to differntiate a compliment from an insinuation(all laughs loudly)as he scared me to death by triggering a false alarm among his pokemons that forced Mrs Ketchum and Mime out of the kitchen(all laugh)so that all could come here today for lunch(all burst into laughter) as he precisely inferred that his mom hadn't started preparing the lunch yet(all burst into laughter) all the while his fiancee
played along excuisitely well directed only through a momentary eye contact(all laugh,Daisy and Lillie smirk at Misty,Misty blushs,Ash laughs and cheers for young flower dream all cheers and laughs even more,Misty blushes more and shows Ash smacking by signals,Ash says 'attitude?' and bursts into laughter,Misty too laughs,all laugh even more,few moments later) well i saw some attitude privately(all laugh) anyway,then the wife threatened to kill me by her Golduck(all laugh) that she was taking away from me(all burst into laughter) on Gengleye(all burst into laughter).Then this man beautifully proceeded along with our business(all laugh) all the while threatening me with his Greninja all the time as he proudly roasted all unimaginable breed of different types of specieses of various Vultures (all burst into laughter) only to insinuate (all laugh) that he and all three of us the other guys should hold a ceremony right in the middle of the pool that's called the damn central battlefield (all laugh) in the gym,which never served his favourite dish for the guests(all laughs) and pick up our respective flowers(all laugh) right in front of all those Vultures (all laugh) and their Lackey the eternal Cerulian pests(all burst into laughter) that ever thought what they're seeing is an illusion(all burst into laughter)and then he concluded with the fact that if he's made the manager there,any dumbnut having the utter buffooness(all burst into laughter) to come as a challenger anytime except 11-11:15 (all burst into laughter) in the morning without 7 league titles and 631 Kanto badges(all laughs more) will be given a most precisely prepared eloquent class on rigourous vultureology of insinuation"(all burst into laughter and laughs for a long time)
Gary(laugh) : "Ash you've truely become a Master of illogical non-implications(all laugh)which isn't imperfectly uninsinuable"(all burst into laughter)..”
Lillie(tears after laughing) : "no Ash,i've hardly ever cried like i did yesterday and i've hardly ever cried like now i'm(all laugh)...and the way to say extremely personal things in this manner so that any unimaginable hellfire(all bursts into laughter) melts away in unimaginable fun and joy in no time...really Mist,keep biting him all the time"(all burst into laughter)

(5 minutes later,Tracy Calls Misty,Misty laughes uncontrollably showing Ash the Phone,Ash murmurs swears)
Misty(laughing) : "Trace... didn't you have enough in the morning?(brusts into laughter)"
Tracy(laugh) : "not at all cause IT'S WAS SO GLORIOUS(both burst into laughter)"
Ash(angry snatches away the Phone,Misty
connects with them Via Ash's phone) : "that you'll have to wait till my wife connects in this forsaken conversation(all laugh,Daisy,Lillie,Gary)..i see the souls are with their mates(all again brusts into laughter)..
(Misty finally connects Ash and all in conference)
Tracy(laugh) : "Misty,this is...
Ash(angry): "Excuse,Excuse(all laugh), didn't i warn you not to utter my wife's
name?and to not breach the 100 foot circle(all laugh)...what
is it Trace,huh?that it takes you 17 damn years to misunderstand that ASH WANTS TO BE WITH MISTY(spelling,all laugh)A-L-O-N-E JUST LIKE GYARADOS(all burst into laughter).."
Tracy(laughing) : "is your Pewter-cum-Viridian Beau alive?(all brusts into laughter)"
Ash(angry) : "why,huh? can't you go jump into ocean with Marill there too(all laugh)?"
Tracy(laughing,Brock finally laughs,who is also in Conference call) : "well your beau's doing it himself(all laugh)"
Ash(frown) : "i see,replacements(all brust into laughter)..why don't you connect the Cerulian Gym as well(all laugh)..the brats must be hungry too(all laugh)..Brock,why is it that the brats can't get the same badge 8 time(all laugh)?..."
Brock(laughing) : "they've never longed enough(all laugh uncontrollably)"
Ash(frown) : "i see,sweetening(all laugh)..but i realize why you're unhappy that you're not getting your customery class on the art of Mantine famillialy that is(all brust into laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing)..but
Trace..now that you've breached my ultimate warning,MARSHADOW(all laugh)..why Trace,huh!that,now you're also sketching Gary's sweet sweet moments(all laugh) and that too he doesn't get much due to being ON-THE-FLY(all burst into laughter,Gary shakes his head laughing).."
Gary(laugh) : "Mr Ketchum Mr Ketchum why are you now Ash(all laugh).."
Tracy (laughing) : "personally also the lonely lesser half of another"(all brusts into laughter).."
Ash(frown) : "Gary what does a pokemon observer do all the days?"(all laugh)
Gary(laughing) : "insinuates(all brust into laughter).."
Ash(frown) : "i see,and by the way,why are the flowers not insinuating grivance?"(all laugh)
Daisy(laughing) : "my man is gently cunning Muk to Muking(all laugh)"
Lillie(laughing) : "and mine perfectly balanced on a moment to moment basis(all laugh)"
Brock(laughing) : "atleast the sinister-
gentleman(all brust into laughter) and the balanced-fly(all laugh) has
their choirs(all laugh),i'm only
beeing memoirs(all laugh and cheer for BOULDER,all burst into laughter along with Brock)"
Ash(scoff) : "hence professionally all have decided to follow Foster to ticklize(all laugh)my rigourous soul-searching(all laugh,Misty blushes and hugs Ash very firmly,Ash laughs and hug her very firmly as well)?"
Lillie(laughes) : "straight to the perfectly balanced vultures(all brust into laughter).."
Daisy(laughing) : "who are indispensible to intricate logic that'll precisely uninsinute(all laughs)any godforsaken contradiction that eludes swearing(all burst into laughter)"
Tracy(laugh) : "through the eloquence of
unimaginable hellfire(all laugh)till
our sweet sweet Ashey-lad finally runs away with his eternally sweet Mist flower(all clap and laugh,smiles,Misty blushs and hides her face in Ash's chest hugging him firmly,Ash laughs and tenders her)"
Ash(frown) : "yeah thanks Muk(all laugh),but i'll hope that no gentleman jackal(all laugh) suddenly appears there even via forsaken mobiles(all laugh)to opine that the third person is better suited to methodically analyze the first and the second's relationship than
themselves(all laugh),by virtue of
his professional observation of Caserin and Luverin AGAIN AND AGAIN EACH DAY(all laugh)..or that no pokemon doctor would try his hand in meticulous cooking of the eloquence of pinpoint observation(all laugh),saying everytime that yeah indeed it's that type of time(all burst into laughter).."
Gary(laugh) : "of not congradulating by means of words(all laugh)"
Ash(laugh) : "that FEELING(all laugh)..but the most heinous thing is that a great researcher would suddenly use all his great intuition and vast
knowledge of types in wrong places and subjects and make a balanced insinuation(all laugh)to a man who was with an absolute brat of a travel-companion named May(all laugh)that had beaked his head off to know everything about his conversations with his girlfriendon costs of perfect proposal(all laugh),who had infact charmed her so much that she thought her big bro is too oblivious and would miss another timely unique chance of having lunch before tea being so naive(all burst into laughter,Brock shakes his head laughing)as her brother isn't well-balanced in sweet talking just like Gyarados(all burst into laughter)so she could bestwo some wisdom upon him from her own experience with another constant rose named Shrew says please dear Spew(all brust into laughter).."
(May&Drew is called by Brock,all brust
into laughter)..
Ash(frown) : "for gods sake..(all laugh)
May(laugh) : "congratulations again for being abale to pass ONE FULL DAY Misty!(all laugh)"
Misty(laugh) : "Thanks again sweetie(all laugh).."
Ash(frown) : "hey,wait there you Daristrum rose wait(all laugh),don't utter my wife's name,don't disturb her, don't mingle with her,DON'T LOOK AT
HER(all laugh)...besides,might i
have a word with your gurdian(all laugh)?
May(laugh) : "we are saying Hi to all(all
reciprocate)..and yeah to my battle-hardened-Mist-stricken bro(all laugh),surely Noivern didn't figure out the ring size did she?(all laughe uncontrollably).."
Ash(frown) : "no it was Samurott(all burst into laughter) hence the trialed petals were many(all laugh)..besides why's that your gurdian never adored us during any(all laugh)?"
Drew(laughing) : "Hi all(all reciprocates),and you too Misty for celebrating the occasion as i roast your beau today finally(Misty laughs and reciprocates,all laugh)..now to answer the Insinuation Master(all laugh),who was told by my Absol that i'm the one for his sis not destined(all laugh) cause night sky is more suited to contemplation than fear(all burst into laughter) and i knew he was going beyond the limits then and later cause Bayleaf and Yveltal intervened(all burst into laughter)..but,the Empress wasn't sent roses cause the Master's biggest hindrence was that he consulted Reshiram(all brusts into laughter)..thus my
endeavour (all laughs)..."
Brock(laugh) : "though master thought he could learn the rosebolt attack,he always was afraid to pick those up
from bushes(all burst into laugher)..."
May(laughs) : "plus,he also never realized the difference in the beads of the rosary of laughter ONLY when it came to his certain better friend(all laugh)could mean something else than the obvious which he told me yeah just giggles girls don't laugh loudly in general do they take Sceptile for example(all brust into laughter).."
Ash(frown) : "i see,what beads are you two little pests calculating now(all laugh)..besides Gary,what is your balanced intuition saying now about how can always a sweet-cunning-little boy from Pallet get so sought after especially when it's his time for his flower-tendering of that type(all brust into laughter)..which should be best left to spared jackets(all brust into laughter).."
Drew(laugh) : "just like Bronzomasnow(all burst into laughter) yeah,Dave told 107 all at a time(all laugh) hence already nicknaming(all laugh)"
...........................................................................................................................
.....(an hour later)...
(Ash and Misty hugging each other firmly,looking at each other and smiling)
Ash(smile) : "just a ceremony to announce"
Misty(keeping her head on Ash's chest,smile) : "Ash,i've decided."
Ash(smile) : "24?"
Misty(smile) : "it could be before"
Ash(smile) : "anytime"
Misty(hugging Ash looking into Ash's eyes,smile) : "first?"
Ash(smile,hugging Misty and looking into her eyes) : "let us follow big-bro atleast till full-hour after alighting."
Misty(same position,smile) : "nostalgia"
Ash(smile,same point) : "not today,but your wish is my command"

Misty(smile,same position) : "plural?"
Ash(smiles,same position) : "combined first name twice,the rest conjunctions"
Misty(smile,same position) : "equal share"
Ash(smile,same position) : "mutual"
(Misty just about to kiss Ash but she stops just before as if stung,position-posture same)
Misty(a bit flustered,smile) : "um..Ash.."
Ash(smile) : "once or all?"
Misty(smile) : "lets get over with the formalities?"
Ash(smile) : "sweetie,soul it to absolute

Misty(laugh) : "why break the mood sweetie?"
Ash(laugh) : "need our brats at absolute lunatic attention(both brusts into laughter).."
(after settling everything,10 minutes later,Ash and Misty same position,but just about could continue eye contact)
Ash&Misty(Unison,smile) : "lets battle absolute lunacy perfectly shared"
(they continue to be in that position being absolutely still for half an hour then Misty just fallsagainst Ash out of total exhaustion,15 minutes later)
Ash(solemn,hugging Misty) : "need to strengthen and recover well in Pinkenberry Mist,that's exactly
why i persisted with 2 weeks,i'll manage all the things you tell me to,you should take complete rest at home...i'm so unhappy to see my sweet flower in such weak condition..this is so amusing
but my sweetie got totally exhausted so soon that too because my dear went with all mental strength...and before that just got too emotional,we'll come here all we want Mist,but in good times ok,sweetie? don't rush,your health
won't allow for much of normalcy what to talk of soul?..please..
Misty(resting on Ash,exhausted,mild voice) : "um..it's just you Ash,i just..just don't want to leave your
side at all.."
Ash(smile, tendering Misty's head) : "i won't take any risks Mist..but you must get healthy,5/6 months with those,just too much,if something pains me still is the agony i saw in my little sweetie after the vomits each time...my sweetie has been a gym leader and performer,so much vitality always since the very
first,but that day,i knew i'll pressure you Mist but inside my room second time it was horrible..continued cause also signalled the poison was getting reduced thus added my next three buddies Jellicent,Noivern and Decidueye were added,you should take complete rest Mist with me just that.."
Misty(smile) : "i'm already having enough
sweetie,but(laugh)..how did you(laugh).."
Ash(laugh) : "no i freaked you out i guess(both brust into laughter)..you were a cute little doll at 16 and ok i wanted to smack your head then(both
brust into laughter),but after 1 week couldn't think without you and couldn't be without you(both laugh),since then i just know my Mist flower soully(both giggle at each other).."
Misty(laugh) : "before that i was totally
confused,but(laugh)..as soon as that
happened,after i calmed down a bit i was scared to death(both laughe)..no Ash,that was really enough,unless you were connected by souls,you could never do that..you never looked at me in anyother way than your soulmate..."
Ash(firmly hugging Misty) : "i just wish i could fondle my sweet Mist flower a bit more(Misty giggles)...we were together for 5 years day and
night 24/7 even in front of mom(both laugh),i don't miss those days cause(laugh)..
Misty(laugh) : "all those journeys are vulture business now(both brust into laughter)"
Ash(laugh) : "yeah,I guess,but i'll tender my flower all i want now(both smile)..privately alone in seclusion(both brust into laughter)...
Misty(smile) : "Orange was my best part Ash,it was heaven.."
Ash(laugh) : "um..was?"(both laughes
uncontrollably)
Misty(laugh) : "is being"(both brust into laughter)
Ash(laugh) : " 'never in a million years'..(both brust into laughter)..but..um..i just want to know
one thing Mist,are you all right?...
Misty(smile) : "honey,i'm absolutely fine,a bit of troubles here and there,only cure in my moon(both smile at each other).."
Ash(smile) : "you know Mist,i just recalled what i thought after you wanted me to call you Mist,i just thought that,just leave it,i'll just abduct you and runway anywhere and fondle my soul all i want(Misty smiles),and now i
know what i should've done they day my sweetie had to part after Jhoto too,same just get the damn bike,destroy it again,and abduct my flower Plain
and Simple ATTITUDE(both laugh)..Mist,can i abduct you,please,please,you are so soully sweet sweet?"(both laugh)
Misty(smile) : "all ways,sweetie"
Ash(smile) : "and just fondle you 12 hours?"
Misty(smile) : "22(both laugh)"
Ash(smile) : "soully enjoyable ain't it?"
Misty(smile) : "great biginning(Misty giggles,Ash smiles)..Ash, formality?(both brust into laughter)
Ash(laugh) : "i've always thought how can people do it in public,but now i know,just do it after ceremony(both brusts into laughter)"
Misty(smile,almost whisper) : "um..Ash..just..."
Ash(laugh) : "if less Cerulianized(both laugh),not more than 5(both smiles at each other).."
Misty(smile) : "and rather insignificant need just for the process to the result"
Ash(smile) : "exactly,but you can understand now the material is absolutely perfect barring luck"
Misty(smile) : "22 in Pinkenberry"
Ash(laugh) : "totally drunk right?"
Misty(smile) : "deluged eternally"
Ash(smile) : "actually my feelings around
